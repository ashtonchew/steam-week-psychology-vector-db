    •biological explanations:
– genetic
– biochemical (the dopamine hypothesis).

• psychological (cognitive) explanation Explanations
Psychologists offer competing explanations for
schizophrenia. We will discuss possible biological
causes (genetics and biochemical) as well as a cognitive
explanation.
Biological
Genetic
One biological explanation for schizophrenia is that
genes or particular combinations of genes are passed on
to offspring which may cause the disorder to develop.
Three ways of investigating the genetic explanation
for schizophrenia are family studies, twin studies and
adoption studies.
Family studies show a general trend in the development
of a disorder for individuals who have close family
members (with whom they share a higher proportion
of their genes) with that disorder. This research
generally shows that if you have close family members
6 Clinical psychology
with schizophrenia you are more likely to also
develop schizophrenia.
KEYWORDS
family study: a type of study investigating
whether biological relatives of those with a
disorder are more likely than non-biological
relatives to be similarly affected
twin study: a type of study that compares sets
of twins to analyse similarities and differences.
This may include concordance for intelligence
or mental disorders. Both monozygotic (MZ)
and dizygotic (DZ) twins are studied, and their
concordance rate is compared
adoption study: a type of study looking at the
similarities between adopted individuals and
their biological parents as a way of investigating
the differing influences of biology and
environment
This suggests that schizophrenia is at least partly
caused by genetics. For example, as shown in Figure
6.4, Gottesman (1991) found that the likelihood of
developing schizophrenia went from 1 % in the general
population, up to 48% if you have an identical twin
with schizophrenia.
Twin studies are a useful way of studying the role of
genetics in schizophrenia because they allow researchers
to study the relative influences of nature and nurture.

For example, identical or monozygotic (MZ) twins
share their entire DNA, whereas non-identical or
dizygotic (DZ) twins only share around 50% of their
DNA. Research tends to show that the concordance of
schizophrenia is higher in MZ twins than DZ twins,
again, suggesting there is a genetic contribution. Hilker
et al. (2017) carried out a twin study with over 30000
twin pairs in Denmark, using two national registers:
Danish Twin Register and the Danish Psychiatric
Central Research Register. They looked not only at
those with a diagnosis of schizophrenia but also those
with related disorders. Hilker et al. concluded that
heritability of schizophrenia was 79%.
KEYWORDS
monozygotic (MZ) twins: identical twins, who
share 100% of their DNA with one another
dizygotic (DZ) twins: non-identical twins, who
share approximately 50% of their DNA with
one another
concordance: the presence of a particular
observable trait or disorder in both individuals
between family members and within a set of
twins; for example, the likelihood that one twin
will have schizophrenia if the other twin
has schizophrenia
heritability: the extent to which the presence
of a disorder (or a trait) is due to the genetic
variance in the population, i.e. the extent to
which it is inherited
Adoption studies allow us to truly separate out
the influence of genetics and the influence of the
environment, something that neither family studies nor
twin studies have been able to do. This is achieved by
comparing a child, raised by an adoptive family, with
their biological parent, who they were not raised by.
Tienari et al. (2000) found schizophrenia in 6. 7% of
adoptees with a biological mother with schizophrenia,
compared to just 4% of a control group (adoptees born
to mothers without schizophrenia). This suggests that,
in line with family studies and twin studies, there is a
genetic influence in the development of schizophrenia.
Biochemical (dopamine hypothesis)
The dopamine hypothesis essentially states that
the brains of people with schizophrenia produce
188 )
more dopamine than the brains of people without
schizophrenia. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, meaning
it is a chemical substance which enables communication
between two neurons. To allow the nerve impulse to pass
between two cells, the neurotransmitter moves across a
small junction known as a 'synapse' (see Figure 6.5).
Figure 6.5: Neurotransmission is the transmission of nerve
impulses from one neuron to another
The dopamine hypothesis identifies a link between
excessive amounts of dopamine or dopamine receptors
and positive symptoms of schizophrenia and related
disorders. Research suggests that neurons that use the
transmitter dopamine either fire too often, or send too
much information. Additionally, research suggests that
an excess of dopamine in particular brain regions can be
related to certain symptoms. For example, an increase
in dopamine in the Broca's region (responsible for
formation of language) can impair logical speech, which
is a classic symptom of schizophrenia.
KEYWORD
neurotransmitter: a chemical messenger that
enables communication between the neurons in
the brain 
Evidence to support this theory comes from drug
trials involving people with schizophrenia and people
without the disorder. Drugs that increase the level
of dopamine in the brain include amphetamines and
cocaine. Large increases in dopamine production
are correlated with an increase in the reporting
of hallucinations and delusions. In people with
schizophrenia, the drugs cause their positive symptoms
to worsen. Patients with Parkinson's disease are often
treated with a synthetic form of dopamine called
L-dopa. If their dosage is too high, it also creates
symptoms in these individuals identical to those in
people with schizophrenia, such as hallucinations
(Lindstrom et al., 1999).
Post-mortem studies and brain scans can also help
us to understand the neurochemistry involved.
Post-mortem studies have found that the brains of
deceased individuals with schizophrenia have a larger
number of dopamine receptors than those without
the disorder. Wise et al. (1974) found that brain fluid
from deceased patients had abnormally low levels of
the enzyme that breaks down dopamine, suggesting
that dopamine may have been present in excessive
quantities.
Positron emission tomography (PET) scan analysis
to measure the amount of dopamine activity in the
brain indicates a greater number of receptors in the
striatum, limbic system, and cortex of the brain
in those with schizophrenia than in those without.
Excessive dopamine activity in these areas may be
linked to positive symptoms, while some research
(Nestler, 1997) suggests that decreased dopamine
activity in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia
patients may correlate with negative symptoms such
as flattened affect. See Figure 6.6 for a PET scan
showing the differences in the dopamine activity of
those with schizophrenia compared to those without
schizophrenia.

Psychological
Cognitive
The cognitive explanation recognises that biological
factors contribute in some way to the positive symptoms
of schizophrenia. For example, Frith (2015) accepts
the role of biochemical processes, brain structure and
genetic influence on the disorder. However, since no
single genetic, structural or biochemical cause has been
identified as being responsible for schizophrenia, he
looked for cognitive explanations of schizophrenia. This
essentially means schizophrenia is viewed as involving
faulty mental processes, rather than relying solely on
physiological explanations.
Frith describes schizophrenia as an 'abnormality of selfmonitoring'. This occurs when patients fail to recognise
that their perceived hallucinations are in fact just inner
speech (the kind of self-talk people normally experience).
It leads them to attribute what they are hearing to
someone else, e.g. a voice speaking to them from an
external source. He tested this idea with patients with 
) CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL AS & A LEVEL PSYCHOLOGY: COURSEBOOK
schizophrenia by asking them to decide whether items that
had been read out loud were done so by themselves, an
experimenter or a computer. Patients with schizophrenia
who had incoherent speech as a symptom performed the
worst at the task, which may be linked to memory and
attention difficulties crucial for self-monitoring.
Frith suggests that another major positive symptom,
delusional thinking, may also arise from a misinterpretation
of perception. Those experiencing delusions may be
applying logical reasoning to their hallucinations, for
example. So, thoughts that are actually self-generated
instead appear to be coming from an external source and
become incorporated in the individual's set of beliefs. These
failures in monitoring can lead to delusions of alien control,
auditory hallucinations and thought insertion. On the other
hand, inability to monitor the intentions of others can lead
to delusions of paranoia and incoherence.
Frith explains that those experiencing negative symptoms
such as avolition have difficulty generating spontaneous
actions. This means that they may find it difficult to
make decisions on how to behave or what to do without
some sort of a prompt from someone or something else.
For example, someone with negative symptoms may
find it difficult to start a conversation with someone else
(a spontaneous action) but they may be able to answer
questions when asked (responding to a stimulus). This may
arise in part due to an impaired theory of mind, which
creates problems in recognising the intentions of others. A
flattening of affect, lack of speech and social withdrawal
all result from difficulties in monitoring their own mental
states and the states of others.
RESE RCH METHODS
There are some methodological issues with samples
in family, twin and adoption studies. The samples
are often relatively small and not necessarily
representative of the whole population. This is
because there are not very many people who are
part of a set of twins where at least one of the twins
has schizophrenia. Hilker et al. (2017), however,
recruited a vast sample of 30,000 twin pairs from
two nationwide registers, ensuring a representative
sample. How could the use of a control group
increase the validity of twin or adoption studies?
Some twin and adoption studies are longitudinal,
which increases the validity as we can see potential
diagnoses and changes in behaviour over time,
which is far more useful than a snapshot study where
we only look at the participants at one point in time.

ISSUES AND DEBATES
The nature versus nurture debate is particularly
relevant to understanding explanations of
schizophrenia and related disorders. Twin studies
tend to suggest a genetic explanation for
schizophrenia through higher concordance rates for
MZ, rather than DZ, twins. However, it is difficult to
isolate nature from nurture. It is likely that MZ twins
are not only more genetically similar than DZ twins
but are also more likely to be treated more similarly
by others. This is because they are always the same
gender (unlike DZs) and may look much more alike.
DZ twins, although they are the same age and
live in the same environment, may experience life
more like ordinary non-twin siblings. This means
that not all differences between MZ and DZ twins
can be simply attributed to genetics. This is where
adoption studies are particularly helpful: they are
able to really allow us to consider the influence of
nature (similarities with the biological parent) and
nurture (similarities with the adoptive parent). How
could the free will versus determinism debate be
applied to explanations of schizophrenia?

Schizophrenia.

key study). 6.1 Schizophrenia
Diagnostic criteria
Psychotic disorders involve a major break from reality in
which the individual perceives the world in a way that is
vastly different to how others perceive it. Schizophrenia
is a very severe type of psychotic disorder.
According to the ICD-11, schizophrenia is characterised
by disturbances across many aspects of a person's
thoughts, feelings, experience and behaviour. There are
many symptoms that may be present in someone with
schizophrenia but the ICD-11 states that there are some
core symptoms:
• Persistent delusions: beliefs that an individual
holds, which are not based in reality, for example
falsely believing that someone is trying to
harm you.
• Persistent hallucinations: sensory experiences, most
commonly auditory (hearing things that are not
there, for example hearing voices; see Figure 6.1)
or visual (seeing things that are not there).
• Thought disorder: an inability to think, and
therefore speak, in an organised manner.
• Experiences of influence, passivity or control - the
belief that your thoughts or actions are influenced
or controlled by someone or something external.
There are many other symptoms that may also
occur, including:
• avolition (lack of motivation)
• flattened affect (blunted emotional expression)
• impaired cognitive function (reduced memory
or attention)
• catatonia (lack of movement or speech).
These symptoms can be described as either 'positive'
or 'negative'. In relation to symptoms of schizophrenia,
these terms do not have the same meaning as they do
usually; we are not referring to 'positive' as 'good' and
'negative' as 'bad'. The four core symptoms in the first
list are all positive symptoms; the four other symptoms
in the second list are negative symptoms.

disorders. It was developed and is updated by

flattened affect: the absence or reduction of an
outward expression of feelings or emotions, such
as a facial expression
positive symptom: an experience that is
'in addition to' or 'a distortion of' normal
experience
negative symptom: this occurs when level of
functioning or experience falls below normal
levels
A positive symptom describes an experience that is 'in
addition to' or 'a distortion of' normal experience. For
example, delusions are positive symptoms because they
involve a distorted way of thinking and hallucinations
are positive symptoms because they involve a distorted
perception of the world.
Figure 6.1: An auditory hallucination (hearing voices) is
one of the core symptoms of schizophrenia 
A negative symptom is where level of functioning or
experience falls below normal levels. For example,
avolition is a negative symptom because a person's
motivation levels are lower than would be considered
normal and flattened affect is a negative symptom
because the expression of emotion is less than would
be expected.
For a diagnosis of schizophrenia to be made, symptoms
must have persisted for at least one month and must
not be due to another health condition (such as a
brain tumour) or due to the effect of a substance
or medication.
Example study
Aneja et al. (2018) carried out three case studies on
individuals who all developed early-onset schizophrenia,
where the symptoms began before the age of
18 years. Core study 1 describes a boy who began
to show a decline in his academic studies and general
behaviour from the age of 10, when his parents
divorced; as a result, he and his mother moved in
with his grandparents and he changed schools. From
the age of 12 he had been hearing voices and as time
went on, he believed his mother and other people
were communicating with the voices. His behaviour
became more erratic, and he muttered to himself and
shouted at people who were not there. He barely slept
and his level of self-care declined dramatically. In the
following years, he was admitted to hospital several
times and given a range of medications to attempt to
get his worsening symptoms under control. The boy
was diagnosed with early-onset schizophrenia and was
released from hospital, on medication that kept his
aggressive behaviours under control. However, he still
suffered from negative symptoms such as apathy, social
withdrawal and a resistance to going to school.

Types of delusion
There are many different types of delusion that someone
with schizophrenia may experience. Some of the most
common types of delusion are:
• Persecutory delusion: a strongly held belief that you
are in danger, that you are being conspired against
and that others are pursuing you to try to do
you harm.
• Grandiose delusion: a strongly held belief that you
are someone with special abilities or special powers,
for example the belief that you are a superhero.
• Delusion of reference: a strongly held belief that
events in the environment are related to you, for
example the belief that a television programme is
talking about you.
There is a range of other types of delusion, but they
are all examples of a belief that is fully believed, despite
strong evidence to contradict it.

The use of the case study by Aneja et al. (2018)
is beneficial as it allows for lots of detail to be
gathered about this one participant. A range of
data collection techniques can be used in a case
study to gather both qualitative and quantitative
data. To study one person, or a small group
of people, in such depth allows for a deeper
understanding and insight into their experience,
increasing the validity of the research. One
problem with the use of case studies is that,
because the research focuses only on one person,
or a small group of people, the results can't be
generalised to the wider population; the study
just tells us about that person (or those people) in
their specific set of circumstances. Furthermore,
the case study cannot be replicated as no two
situations will be exactly the same. What could be
the strengths of using interviews in a case study?
ISSUES AND DEBATES
The use of children in psychological research is a
sensitive one. When children are used in research,
for example the study by Aneja et al. (2018), the
ethical issues need to be considered even more
closely. It is more difficult for children to give
fully informed consent to take part in research as
they may not understand fully what is involved,
so parents must give fully informed consent
along with their children. Protection from harm
is particularly important because children may
respond to things differently to adults and they
may find it difficult to communicate their feelings.
This also applies to right to withdraw: a child
may not understand fully that they can withdraw
from the research, or they may not know how to
express this effectively.

V. (2003). Can virtual reality be used to investigate
persecutory ideation? The journal of nervous and
mental disease, 191(8), 509-514.
Context
In the 1990s and early 2000s, virtual reality (VR) was a
very new technology to be used in psychology. VR was
primarily used to investigate spatial awareness and other
cognitive skills, as well as social interactions. However,
VR has also been shown to be useful in treating a range
of different psychological disorders, including phobias
and anxiety disorders. Research by Rothbaum et al.
(2000) shows that people suffering from a range of
phobias (including phobias of specific animals, objects
and situations) have been successfully treated using VR.
In this case VR is used to carry out exposure therapy,
where the individual is gradually exposed to more
fearful instances of their phobic stimulus until they no
longer feel fear of the stimulus. VR bas also been used
to help reduce a fear of public speaking, with virtual
people (avatars) being able to elicit anxiety and therefore
provide an opportunity for the person to overcome their
fear (Slater et al. 1999).
Main theories and explanations
Persecutory ideation is the belief (without any evidence)
that other people are being hostile towards you, or that
they have negative feelings towards you. Persecutory
ideation is one of the most common symptoms of
schizophrenia. Persecutory ideation can have a profoundly
negative effect on someone's life as it can lead to complete
social withdrawal and an inability to maintain usual
activities due to fear of hostility from others. However,
when someone is experiencing persecutory ideation as a
symptom of schizophrenia it can be difficult to understand
their experience due to the complex nature of the disorder.
If VR can be used to develop a greater understanding
of persecutory ideation in people without schizophrenia
this could help develop a better understanding of
persecutory ideation in those with schizophrenia. A better
understanding could, in tum, lead to better ways of
helping those with schizophrenia understand and learn to
cope with their persecutory ideation.
KEYWORDS

simulation where a person uses special goggles
and a screen or gloves to interact with a threedimensional environment. See Figure 6.2
persecutory ideations: the belief that people
want to hurt you, despite there being no
evidence to back this up 
Figure 6.2: Virtual reality has been used to understand
and help treat psychological disorders
Aims
The aim was to investigate whether participants
without a history of mental illness have thoughts of
a persecutory nature in virtual reality. The research
also aimed to find out whether there are cognitive
or emotional factors that predict the likelihood of
persecutory ideation being shown in virtual reality.
The researchers hypothesised that a small number of
participants would have thoughts of a persecutory
nature in virtual reality, and that these would be people
with higher levels of emotional distress and paranoia.
Design
The sample consisted of 12 male and 12 female
participants, all students, or administrative staff from
University College London, UK, with an average
age of 26 years. All participants had no history of
mental illness. Participants were recruited using
volunteer sampling, where participants responded to an
advertisement within University College London.
A lab experiment was used, where participants were
trained how to use the VR equipment and then asked
to enter the virtual environment (a library scene) for
5 minutes. Participants were not told the research
was investigating persecutory ideation, but were
asked to explore the environment and try to form an
6 Clinical psychology
impression of the people in the room and what those
people may think of the participant. There were five
avatars in the scene: three sat at one desk and two
sat at another desk. Occasionally the avatars showed
ambiguous behaviour, such as smiling, looking, talking
to each other (see Figure 6.3).
After leaving the VR environment, participants were
given a range of questionnaires. One questionnaire was
the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), which is a 53-item
self-report measure designed to assess nine symptom
dimensions over the last seven days. The symptoms
measured include: interpersonal sensitivity (a tendency to
focus on feelings of personal inadequacy or inferiority,
and a feeling of marked discomfort during interpersonal
interactions), depression (depressive disorder (unipolar)),
anxiety, hostility and psychoticism. Other questionnaires
were given, which measured anxiety and paranoia, as
well as a 'sense of presence' (the extent to which the
participant felt they were a part of the virtual world)
and specific ideations of persecution. The questionnaires
included closed questions, where participants gave
their answer on a numerical scale (e.g. the measure of
anxiety had 20 items each measured on a scale of 1-4).
To allow for the possibility that the questionnaires after
the virtual reality exercise may prime participants for
persecutory thoughts, half of the participants (equal
number of males and females) completed questionnaires
both before and after the virtual reality experience.
Semi-structured interviews were also carried out to find
out the participants' thoughts and feelings about the
virtual reality experience.

Results, findings and conclusions
There was a significant correlation between scores on
the paranoia questionnaire and the paranoia score
given based on the interview. The results showed that,
for the most part, participants had positive opinions
about the avatars, but some had ideas of persecution.
For example, for the item 'they were talking about
me behind my back', 11 participants did not agree,
eight agreed a little, three agreed moderately and two
agreed totally. Some examples of the statements on the
paranoia questionnaire can be seen in Table 6.1. There
were no significant differences in the persecution scores
between males and females, or between those who had
questionnaires only after, or before and after the task.
In terms of predictive factors for persecutory ideation
in VR, persecutory thoughts about the avatars did
not significantly correlate with paranoia score. Higher
levels of interpersonal sensitivity and higher levels
of anxiety were significantly correlated with higher
levels of persecutory thoughts in VR. Freeman et al.
concluded that people do attribute mental states to VR
characters and, although these are usually positive, they
can be persecutory in nature. People are more likely to
show persecutory ideation if they show high levels of
interpersonal sensitivity or anxiety.

Evaluation
The study by Freeman et al. (2003) uses a specially
designed VR program that allows for a standardised
approach to assessment which increases the reliability
of measurement. However, it compromises the
ecological validity of the assessment, as it involves
a simulated environment quite different from what
we typically experience. It relies on self-report in that
users of VR were asked to make comments about
their experiences, which may lead to response bias.
However, by using a combination of numerical scales
and semi-structured interviews, the researchers were
able to gather a combination of quantitative and
qualitative data. This allows for data analysis to be
carried out on the quantitative data while also allowing
detailed information from the qualitative data. The
use of a control where half the participants completed
questionnaires both before and after the VR increases
the validity, by ensuring the questionnaires themselves
are not eliciting feelings of persecution. 
The sample was relatively small (24), and all participants
were from the same university (either students or
administrative staff) so this is not a representative
sample, which limits the generalisability of the results.
However, there was an equal split of males and females
so there is no gender bias.
The research was ethical in that participants
gave consent, had the right to withdraw and were
debriefed afterwards. Participants who scored high
in anxiety or interpersonal sensitivity and those who
reported persecutory ideation may be somewhat
distressed by these outcomes, so a full and thorough
debrief would be essential in order to protect them
from harm.
It is important to consider application to everyday life
with Freeman et al.'s study. On the one hand the findings
of the study can be applied to everyday life by allowing
a greater understanding of factors that may predict
persecutory ideation. The findings that VR can be used
effectively as a measure of persecutory ideation is also
applicable to everyday life as this suggests VR could be
used again to measure similar experiences. However,
the application to everyday life is limited because the
study used VR, not actual real-life situations. This study
shows us how people respond and interpret behaviours
and intentions in avatars in VR, but this cannot tell
us for certain how people would respond to similar
experiences in everyday life.
