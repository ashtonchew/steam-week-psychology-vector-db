Schizophrenia.

key study).","6.1 Schizophrenia
Diagnostic criteria
Psychotic disorders involve a major break from reality in
which the individual perceives the world in a way that is
vastly different to how others perceive it. Schizophrenia
is a very severe type of psychotic disorder.
According to the ICD-11, schizophrenia is characterised
by disturbances across many aspects of a person's
thoughts, feelings, experience and behaviour. There are
many symptoms that may be present in someone with
schizophrenia but the ICD-11 states that there are some
core symptoms:
• Persistent delusions: beliefs that an individual
holds, which are not based in reality, for example
falsely believing that someone is trying to
harm you.
• Persistent hallucinations: sensory experiences, most
commonly auditory (hearing things that are not
there, for example hearing voices; see Figure 6.1)
or visual (seeing things that are not there).
• Thought disorder: an inability to think, and
therefore speak, in an organised manner.
• Experiences of influence, passivity or control - the
belief that your thoughts or actions are influenced
or controlled by someone or something external.
There are many other symptoms that may also
occur, including:
• avolition (lack of motivation)
• flattened affect (blunted emotional expression)
• impaired cognitive function (reduced memory
or attention)
• catatonia (lack of movement or speech).
These symptoms can be described as either 'positive'
or 'negative'. In relation to symptoms of schizophrenia,
these terms do not have the same meaning as they do
usually; we are not referring to 'positive' as 'good' and
'negative' as 'bad'. The four core symptoms in the first
list are all positive symptoms; the four other symptoms
in the second list are negative symptoms.

ICD-11: the 11 th edition of the International
Classification of Diseases. This is the global
standard for coding health information and
includes both physical and mental health
disorders. It was developed and is updated by
the World Health Organization (WHO)
flattened affect: the absence or reduction of an
outward expression of feelings or emotions, such
as a facial expression
positive symptom: an experience that is
'in addition to' or 'a distortion of' normal
experience
negative symptom: this occurs when level of
functioning or experience falls below normal
levels
A positive symptom describes an experience that is 'in
addition to' or 'a distortion of' normal experience. For
example, delusions are positive symptoms because they
involve a distorted way of thinking and hallucinations
are positive symptoms because they involve a distorted
perception of the world.
Figure 6.1: An auditory hallucination (hearing voices) is
one of the core symptoms of schizophrenia 
A negative symptom is where level of functioning or
experience falls below normal levels. For example,
avolition is a negative symptom because a person's
motivation levels are lower than would be considered
normal and flattened affect is a negative symptom
because the expression of emotion is less than would
be expected.
For a diagnosis of schizophrenia to be made, symptoms
must have persisted for at least one month and must
not be due to another health condition (such as a
brain tumour) or due to the effect of a substance
or medication.
Example study
Aneja et al. (2018) carried out three case studies on
individuals who all developed early-onset schizophrenia,
where the symptoms began before the age of
18 years. Core study 1 describes a boy who began
to show a decline in his academic studies and general
behaviour from the age of 10, when his parents
divorced; as a result, he and his mother moved in
with his grandparents and he changed schools. From
the age of 12 he had been hearing voices and as time
went on, he believed his mother and other people
were communicating with the voices. His behaviour
became more erratic, and he muttered to himself and
shouted at people who were not there. He barely slept
and his level of self-care declined dramatically. In the
following years, he was admitted to hospital several
times and given a range of medications to attempt to
get his worsening symptoms under control. The boy
was diagnosed with early-onset schizophrenia and was
released from hospital, on medication that kept his
aggressive behaviours under control. However, he still
suffered from negative symptoms such as apathy, social
withdrawal and a resistance to going to school.

Types of delusion
There are many different types of delusion that someone
with schizophrenia may experience. Some of the most
common types of delusion are:
• Persecutory delusion: a strongly held belief that you
are in danger, that you are being conspired against
and that others are pursuing you to try to do
you harm.
• Grandiose delusion: a strongly held belief that you
are someone with special abilities or special powers,
for example the belief that you are a superhero.
• Delusion of reference: a strongly held belief that
events in the environment are related to you, for
example the belief that a television programme is
talking about you.
There is a range of other types of delusion, but they
are all examples of a belief that is fully believed, despite
strong evidence to contradict it.

The use of the case study by Aneja et al. (2018)
is beneficial as it allows for lots of detail to be
gathered about this one participant. A range of
data collection techniques can be used in a case
study to gather both qualitative and quantitative
data. To study one person, or a small group
of people, in such depth allows for a deeper
understanding and insight into their experience,
increasing the validity of the research. One
problem with the use of case studies is that,
because the research focuses only on one person,
or a small group of people, the results can't be
generalised to the wider population; the study
just tells us about that person (or those people) in
their specific set of circumstances. Furthermore,
the case study cannot be replicated as no two
situations will be exactly the same. What could be
the strengths of using interviews in a case study?
ISSUES AND DEBATES
The use of children in psychological research is a
sensitive one. When children are used in research,
for example the study by Aneja et al. (2018), the
ethical issues need to be considered even more
closely. It is more difficult for children to give
fully informed consent to take part in research as
they may not understand fully what is involved,
so parents must give fully informed consent
along with their children. Protection from harm
is particularly important because children may
respond to things differently to adults and they
may find it difficult to communicate their feelings.
This also applies to right to withdraw: a child
may not understand fully that they can withdraw
from the research, or they may not know how to
express this effectively.
Key study: Freeman et al.
(2003)
Freeman, D., Slater, M., Bebbington, P. E., Garety,
P. A., Kuipers, E., Fowler, D., ... & Vinayagamoorthy,
V. (2003). Can virtual reality be used to investigate
persecutory ideation? The journal of nervous and
mental disease, 191(8), 509-514.
Context
In the 1990s and early 2000s, virtual reality (VR) was a
very new technology to be used in psychology. VR was
primarily used to investigate spatial awareness and other
cognitive skills, as well as social interactions. However,
VR has also been shown to be useful in treating a range
of different psychological disorders, including phobias
and anxiety disorders. Research by Rothbaum et al.
(2000) shows that people suffering from a range of
phobias (including phobias of specific animals, objects
and situations) have been successfully treated using VR.
In this case VR is used to carry out exposure therapy,
where the individual is gradually exposed to more
fearful instances of their phobic stimulus until they no
longer feel fear of the stimulus. VR bas also been used
to help reduce a fear of public speaking, with virtual
people (avatars) being able to elicit anxiety and therefore
provide an opportunity for the person to overcome their
fear (Slater et al. 1999).
Main theories and explanations
Persecutory ideation is the belief (without any evidence)
that other people are being hostile towards you, or that
they have negative feelings towards you. Persecutory
ideation is one of the most common symptoms of
schizophrenia. Persecutory ideation can have a profoundly
negative effect on someone's life as it can lead to complete
social withdrawal and an inability to maintain usual
activities due to fear of hostility from others. However,
when someone is experiencing persecutory ideation as a
symptom of schizophrenia it can be difficult to understand
their experience due to the complex nature of the disorder.
If VR can be used to develop a greater understanding
of persecutory ideation in people without schizophrenia
this could help develop a better understanding of
persecutory ideation in those with schizophrenia. A better
understanding could, in tum, lead to better ways of
helping those with schizophrenia understand and learn to
cope with their persecutory ideation.
KEYWORDS
virtual reality (VR): a computer-generated
simulation where a person uses special goggles
and a screen or gloves to interact with a threedimensional environment. See Figure 6.2
persecutory ideations: the belief that people
want to hurt you, despite there being no
evidence to back this up 
Figure 6.2: Virtual reality has been used to understand
and help treat psychological disorders
Aims
The aim was to investigate whether participants
without a history of mental illness have thoughts of
a persecutory nature in virtual reality. The research
also aimed to find out whether there are cognitive
or emotional factors that predict the likelihood of
persecutory ideation being shown in virtual reality.
The researchers hypothesised that a small number of
participants would have thoughts of a persecutory
nature in virtual reality, and that these would be people
with higher levels of emotional distress and paranoia.
Design
The sample consisted of 12 male and 12 female
participants, all students, or administrative staff from
University College London, UK, with an average
age of 26 years. All participants had no history of
mental illness. Participants were recruited using
volunteer sampling, where participants responded to an
advertisement within University College London.
A lab experiment was used, where participants were
trained how to use the VR equipment and then asked
to enter the virtual environment (a library scene) for
5 minutes. Participants were not told the research
was investigating persecutory ideation, but were
asked to explore the environment and try to form an
6 Clinical psychology
impression of the people in the room and what those
people may think of the participant. There were five
avatars in the scene: three sat at one desk and two
sat at another desk. Occasionally the avatars showed
ambiguous behaviour, such as smiling, looking, talking
to each other (see Figure 6.3).
After leaving the VR environment, participants were
given a range of questionnaires. One questionnaire was
the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), which is a 53-item
self-report measure designed to assess nine symptom
dimensions over the last seven days. The symptoms
measured include: interpersonal sensitivity (a tendency to
focus on feelings of personal inadequacy or inferiority,
and a feeling of marked discomfort during interpersonal
interactions), depression (depressive disorder (unipolar)),
anxiety, hostility and psychoticism. Other questionnaires
were given, which measured anxiety and paranoia, as
well as a 'sense of presence' (the extent to which the
participant felt they were a part of the virtual world)
and specific ideations of persecution. The questionnaires
included closed questions, where participants gave
their answer on a numerical scale (e.g. the measure of
anxiety had 20 items each measured on a scale of 1-4).
To allow for the possibility that the questionnaires after
the virtual reality exercise may prime participants for
persecutory thoughts, half of the participants (equal
number of males and females) completed questionnaires
both before and after the virtual reality experience.
Semi-structured interviews were also carried out to find
out the participants' thoughts and feelings about the
virtual reality experience.

Results, findings and conclusions
There was a significant correlation between scores on
the paranoia questionnaire and the paranoia score
given based on the interview. The results showed that,
for the most part, participants had positive opinions
about the avatars, but some had ideas of persecution.
For example, for the item 'they were talking about
me behind my back', 11 participants did not agree,
eight agreed a little, three agreed moderately and two
agreed totally. Some examples of the statements on the
paranoia questionnaire can be seen in Table 6.1. There
were no significant differences in the persecution scores
between males and females, or between those who had
questionnaires only after, or before and after the task.
In terms of predictive factors for persecutory ideation
in VR, persecutory thoughts about the avatars did
not significantly correlate with paranoia score. Higher
levels of interpersonal sensitivity and higher levels
of anxiety were significantly correlated with higher
levels of persecutory thoughts in VR. Freeman et al.
concluded that people do attribute mental states to VR
characters and, although these are usually positive, they
can be persecutory in nature. People are more likely to
show persecutory ideation if they show high levels of
interpersonal sensitivity or anxiety.

'Some were intimidating'

the paranoia questionnaire in Freeman et al.'s research
Evaluation
The study by Freeman et al. (2003) uses a specially
designed VR program that allows for a standardised
approach to assessment which increases the reliability
of measurement. However, it compromises the
ecological validity of the assessment, as it involves
a simulated environment quite different from what
we typically experience. It relies on self-report in that
users of VR were asked to make comments about
their experiences, which may lead to response bias.
However, by using a combination of numerical scales
and semi-structured interviews, the researchers were
able to gather a combination of quantitative and
qualitative data. This allows for data analysis to be
carried out on the quantitative data while also allowing
detailed information from the qualitative data. The
use of a control where half the participants completed
questionnaires both before and after the VR increases
the validity, by ensuring the questionnaires themselves
are not eliciting feelings of persecution. 
The sample was relatively small (24), and all participants
were from the same university (either students or
administrative staff) so this is not a representative
sample, which limits the generalisability of the results.
However, there was an equal split of males and females
so there is no gender bias.
The research was ethical in that participants
gave consent, had the right to withdraw and were
debriefed afterwards. Participants who scored high
in anxiety or interpersonal sensitivity and those who
reported persecutory ideation may be somewhat
distressed by these outcomes, so a full and thorough
debrief would be essential in order to protect them
from harm.
It is important to consider application to everyday life
with Freeman et al.'s study. On the one hand the findings
of the study can be applied to everyday life by allowing
a greater understanding of factors that may predict
persecutory ideation. The findings that VR can be used
effectively as a measure of persecutory ideation is also
applicable to everyday life as this suggests VR could be
used again to measure similar experiences. However,
the application to everyday life is limited because the
study used VR, not actual real-life situations. This study
shows us how people respond and interpret behaviours
and intentions in avatars in VR, but this cannot tell
us for certain how people would respond to similar
experiences in everyday life."
"•biological explanations:
– genetic
– biochemical (the dopamine hypothesis).

• psychological (cognitive) explanation","Explanations
Psychologists offer competing explanations for
schizophrenia. We will discuss possible biological
causes (genetics and biochemical) as well as a cognitive
explanation.
Biological
Genetic
One biological explanation for schizophrenia is that
genes or particular combinations of genes are passed on
to offspring which may cause the disorder to develop.
Three ways of investigating the genetic explanation
for schizophrenia are family studies, twin studies and
adoption studies.
Family studies show a general trend in the development
of a disorder for individuals who have close family
members (with whom they share a higher proportion
of their genes) with that disorder. This research
generally shows that if you have close family members
6 Clinical psychology
with schizophrenia you are more likely to also
develop schizophrenia.
KEYWORDS
family study: a type of study investigating
whether biological relatives of those with a
disorder are more likely than non-biological
relatives to be similarly affected
twin study: a type of study that compares sets
of twins to analyse similarities and differences.
This may include concordance for intelligence
or mental disorders. Both monozygotic (MZ)
and dizygotic (DZ) twins are studied, and their
concordance rate is compared
adoption study: a type of study looking at the
similarities between adopted individuals and
their biological parents as a way of investigating
the differing influences of biology and
environment
This suggests that schizophrenia is at least partly
caused by genetics. For example, as shown in Figure
6.4, Gottesman (1991) found that the likelihood of
developing schizophrenia went from 1 % in the general
population, up to 48% if you have an identical twin
with schizophrenia.
Twin studies are a useful way of studying the role of
genetics in schizophrenia because they allow researchers
to study the relative influences of nature and nurture.

For example, identical or monozygotic (MZ) twins
share their entire DNA, whereas non-identical or
dizygotic (DZ) twins only share around 50% of their
DNA. Research tends to show that the concordance of
schizophrenia is higher in MZ twins than DZ twins,
again, suggesting there is a genetic contribution. Hilker
et al. (2017) carried out a twin study with over 30000
twin pairs in Denmark, using two national registers:
Danish Twin Register and the Danish Psychiatric
Central Research Register. They looked not only at
those with a diagnosis of schizophrenia but also those
with related disorders. Hilker et al. concluded that
heritability of schizophrenia was 79%.
KEYWORDS
monozygotic (MZ) twins: identical twins, who
share 100% of their DNA with one another
dizygotic (DZ) twins: non-identical twins, who
share approximately 50% of their DNA with
one another
concordance: the presence of a particular
observable trait or disorder in both individuals
between family members and within a set of
twins; for example, the likelihood that one twin
will have schizophrenia if the other twin
has schizophrenia
heritability: the extent to which the presence
of a disorder (or a trait) is due to the genetic
variance in the population, i.e. the extent to
which it is inherited
Adoption studies allow us to truly separate out
the influence of genetics and the influence of the
environment, something that neither family studies nor
twin studies have been able to do. This is achieved by
comparing a child, raised by an adoptive family, with
their biological parent, who they were not raised by.
Tienari et al. (2000) found schizophrenia in 6. 7% of
adoptees with a biological mother with schizophrenia,
compared to just 4% of a control group (adoptees born
to mothers without schizophrenia). This suggests that,
in line with family studies and twin studies, there is a
genetic influence in the development of schizophrenia.
Biochemical (dopamine hypothesis)
The dopamine hypothesis essentially states that
the brains of people with schizophrenia produce
188 )
more dopamine than the brains of people without
schizophrenia. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, meaning
it is a chemical substance which enables communication
between two neurons. To allow the nerve impulse to pass
between two cells, the neurotransmitter moves across a
small junction known as a 'synapse' (see Figure 6.5).
Figure 6.5: Neurotransmission is the transmission of nerve
impulses from one neuron to another
The dopamine hypothesis identifies a link between
excessive amounts of dopamine or dopamine receptors
and positive symptoms of schizophrenia and related
disorders. Research suggests that neurons that use the
transmitter dopamine either fire too often, or send too
much information. Additionally, research suggests that
an excess of dopamine in particular brain regions can be
related to certain symptoms. For example, an increase
in dopamine in the Broca's region (responsible for
formation of language) can impair logical speech, which
is a classic symptom of schizophrenia.
KEYWORD
neurotransmitter: a chemical messenger that
enables communication between the neurons in
the brain 
Evidence to support this theory comes from drug
trials involving people with schizophrenia and people
without the disorder. Drugs that increase the level
of dopamine in the brain include amphetamines and
cocaine. Large increases in dopamine production
are correlated with an increase in the reporting
of hallucinations and delusions. In people with
schizophrenia, the drugs cause their positive symptoms
to worsen. Patients with Parkinson's disease are often
treated with a synthetic form of dopamine called
L-dopa. If their dosage is too high, it also creates
symptoms in these individuals identical to those in
people with schizophrenia, such as hallucinations
(Lindstrom et al., 1999).
Post-mortem studies and brain scans can also help
us to understand the neurochemistry involved.
Post-mortem studies have found that the brains of
deceased individuals with schizophrenia have a larger
number of dopamine receptors than those without
the disorder. Wise et al. (1974) found that brain fluid
from deceased patients had abnormally low levels of
the enzyme that breaks down dopamine, suggesting
that dopamine may have been present in excessive
quantities.
Positron emission tomography (PET) scan analysis
to measure the amount of dopamine activity in the
brain indicates a greater number of receptors in the
striatum, limbic system, and cortex of the brain
in those with schizophrenia than in those without.
Excessive dopamine activity in these areas may be
linked to positive symptoms, while some research
(Nestler, 1997) suggests that decreased dopamine
activity in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia
patients may correlate with negative symptoms such
as flattened affect. See Figure 6.6 for a PET scan
showing the differences in the dopamine activity of
those with schizophrenia compared to those without
schizophrenia.

Psychological
Cognitive
The cognitive explanation recognises that biological
factors contribute in some way to the positive symptoms
of schizophrenia. For example, Frith (2015) accepts
the role of biochemical processes, brain structure and
genetic influence on the disorder. However, since no
single genetic, structural or biochemical cause has been
identified as being responsible for schizophrenia, he
looked for cognitive explanations of schizophrenia. This
essentially means schizophrenia is viewed as involving
faulty mental processes, rather than relying solely on
physiological explanations.
Frith describes schizophrenia as an 'abnormality of selfmonitoring'. This occurs when patients fail to recognise
that their perceived hallucinations are in fact just inner
speech (the kind of self-talk people normally experience).
It leads them to attribute what they are hearing to
someone else, e.g. a voice speaking to them from an
external source. He tested this idea with patients with 
) CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL AS & A LEVEL PSYCHOLOGY: COURSEBOOK
schizophrenia by asking them to decide whether items that
had been read out loud were done so by themselves, an
experimenter or a computer. Patients with schizophrenia
who had incoherent speech as a symptom performed the
worst at the task, which may be linked to memory and
attention difficulties crucial for self-monitoring.
Frith suggests that another major positive symptom,
delusional thinking, may also arise from a misinterpretation
of perception. Those experiencing delusions may be
applying logical reasoning to their hallucinations, for
example. So, thoughts that are actually self-generated
instead appear to be coming from an external source and
become incorporated in the individual's set of beliefs. These
failures in monitoring can lead to delusions of alien control,
auditory hallucinations and thought insertion. On the other
hand, inability to monitor the intentions of others can lead
to delusions of paranoia and incoherence.
Frith explains that those experiencing negative symptoms
such as avolition have difficulty generating spontaneous
actions. This means that they may find it difficult to
make decisions on how to behave or what to do without
some sort of a prompt from someone or something else.
For example, someone with negative symptoms may
find it difficult to start a conversation with someone else
(a spontaneous action) but they may be able to answer
questions when asked (responding to a stimulus). This may
arise in part due to an impaired theory of mind, which
creates problems in recognising the intentions of others. A
flattening of affect, lack of speech and social withdrawal
all result from difficulties in monitoring their own mental
states and the states of others.
RESE RCH METHODS
There are some methodological issues with samples
in family, twin and adoption studies. The samples
are often relatively small and not necessarily
representative of the whole population. This is
because there are not very many people who are
part of a set of twins where at least one of the twins
has schizophrenia. Hilker et al. (2017), however,
recruited a vast sample of 30,000 twin pairs from
two nationwide registers, ensuring a representative
sample. How could the use of a control group
increase the validity of twin or adoption studies?
Some twin and adoption studies are longitudinal,
which increases the validity as we can see potential
diagnoses and changes in behaviour over time,
which is far more useful than a snapshot study where
we only look at the participants at one point in time.
190 )
ISSUES AND DEBATES
The nature versus nurture debate is particularly
relevant to understanding explanations of
schizophrenia and related disorders. Twin studies
tend to suggest a genetic explanation for
schizophrenia through higher concordance rates for
MZ, rather than DZ, twins. However, it is difficult to
isolate nature from nurture. It is likely that MZ twins
are not only more genetically similar than DZ twins
but are also more likely to be treated more similarly
by others. This is because they are always the same
gender (unlike DZs) and may look much more alike.
DZ twins, although they are the same age and
live in the same environment, may experience life
more like ordinary non-twin siblings. This means
that not all differences between MZ and DZ twins
can be simply attributed to genetics. This is where
adoption studies are particularly helpful: they are
able to really allow us to consider the influence of
nature (similarities with the biological parent) and
nurture (similarities with the adoptive parent). How
could the free will versus determinism debate be
applied to explanations of schizophrenia?"

Biochemical treatments: typical and atypical

Before dopamine was identified as an explanation for
schizophrenia in the 1950s, there was no treatment for
schizophrenia; patients were just hospitalised in the
hope symptoms would improve. During the 1950s,
antipsychotics were developed, which work by reducing the 
activity of dopamine and as a result reducing symptoms.
Antipsychotics are usually the first treatment given after a
diagnosis of schizophrenia and they are usually continued
to be used alongside psychological therapies such as
cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT). There are two types
of antipsychotics: typical and atypical.

Typical antipsychotics, also referred to as first generation,
were developed in the 1950s. An example is chlorpromazine.
They work by reducing the effects of dopamine and
therefore reducing the positive symptoms of schizophrenia
(mainly hallucinations and delusions). Typical antipsychotics
are dopamine antagonists, which means that they block
dopamine receptors so there is less dopamine activity.
To be effective treatments, they must block a considerable
proportion of dopamine activity. However, the downside
to this is that there are many undesirable side effects.

generation, were developed in the 1990s. An example is
clozapine. Compared to typical antipsychotics, atypical
antipsychotics have a lower risk of side effects, have
a beneficial effect on negative symptoms as well as
positive symptoms and have been shown to be effective
for 'treatment-resistant' patients (those for whom other
treatments have been ineffective). Atypical antipsychotics
work by blocking dopamine, but unlike typical
antipsychotics, they rapidly dissociate (they only block
dopamine activity for a short period of time). The rapid
6 Clinical psychology
dissociation allows for normal dopamine transmission to
take place, which is what leads to less side effects.
KEYWORD
atypical antipsychotics: antipsychotics
developed in the 1990s that affect dopamine
levels in order to reduce both positive and
negative symptoms of schizophrenia
The use of antipsychotic drugs has been thoroughly
researched using randomised control trials (RCTs).
These trials are often double-blind placebo controlled,
and consistently show that around 50% of those taking
antipsychotic medication show significant improvement
in their condition after four to six weeks. Around 30-
40% show partial improvement; however, a substantial
minority of those remaining patients show little to no
improvement in their functioning.
Relapse rates, where a person's symptoms return after a
period of time, using antipsychotics can be quite high.
One reason for this is that patients are usually directed
to keep taking medication after acute psychotic episodes,
even in periods of remission (periods of time where they
are not experiencing symptoms), albeit at lower doses.
However, the medication can cause unpleasant side
effects that, combined with a reduction in symptoms,
can result in non-adherence to medication. Side effects for
typical antipsychotics are common, and can be severe, for
example extrapyramidal symptoms (EPSs) and tardive
dyskenesia (TD). Both of these affect motor control
and can result in involuntary spasms and abnormal
movements of the face and body. Side effects for atypical
antipsychotics tend to be less severe and can include
weight gain, drowsiness and difficulties in concentration.

Electro-convulsive therapy
Electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) is another biological
treatment which has been applied to help alleviate
symptoms of schizophrenia. For hundreds of years,
inducing seizures by other methods had been used
to treat psychiatric problems. By the 1930s it was
mistakenly believed that schizophrenia was very rare
in those who suffered from epilepsy, which inspired
the first trials of ECT on patients with schizophrenia.
Physicians U go Cerletti and Lucio Bini had discovered
the potential for electricity to be used to induce seizures
and unconsciousness by observing the effect electric
shocks had on cattle. They modified this technique
to be applied to humans; however, without the use of
anti-anxiety drugs or anaesthetic, patients were often
traumatised and suffered broken bones.
Modern ECT (see Figure 6.7) is a much more refined
version of the traditional method, although it is still
considered controversial. It involves passing electricity
through the brain with the intention of inducing a
seizure; the seizure is the 'treatment' rather than the
electricity. Patients usually undergo a course of ECT
treatments ranging from six to 12 sessions, although
some may need fewer. It is typically given twice a
week during the treatment period, or less commonly
at longer intervals to prevent relapse of symptoms.
Instead of applying ECT bilaterally (across both brain
hemispheres), it is now applied unilaterally to the
non-dominant hemisphere only, to reduce memory
loss. Despite improvements to the technique, there
are still significant risks involved to the individual.
The procedure affects the central nervous system and
cardiovascular system, which can be dangerous for those
with pre-existing medical conditions. Memory loss is
still a common side effect of ECT, but this is usually
temporary. More serious but extremely rare side effects
can include lasting neurological damage or even death.
There is still no generally accepted explanation for the
effect ECT has on the treatment of mental disorders.
One theory is that it affects post-synaptic responses to
central nervous system transmitters. ECT is rarely used
in the treatment of schizophrenia because of a lack
of evidence to suggest it is more effective than other
forms of therapy, such as antipsychotics. Evidence
suggests that ECT can be effective during acute episodes
of psychosis where fast, short-term improvement of
severe symptoms is needed. There is also some evidence
indicating it may be most effective for individuals
experiencing catatonic symptoms (National Institute for
Clinical Excellence (NICE), 2015).

the traditional method but it is still considered to be

Psychological
Cognitive-behavioural therapy
Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is an approach
to the treatment of mental health disorders which
incorporates principles of both the cognitive and
behaviourist approaches to psychology. It departs from
the behaviourists' strict focus on observable behaviour
in order to recognise the influence of invisible cognitive
processes on learning. CBT is a talking therapy
designed to help people change through recognising and
challenging the thoughts that underlie their behaviours.
CBT is almost always used as a treatment alongside
antipsychotic drugs, and often requires an initial
treatment with antipsychotics to stabilise the patient
enough to be able to engage in the therapy.
Example study
Sensky et al. (2000) carried out a randomised control
trial to compare the effectiveness of CBT with a control
group who engaged in 'befriending'. Befriending
sessions included informal one-to-one discussions about
hobbies, sports or current affairs. This comparison was
used to test whether CBT itself is effective, rather than
just the experience of talking to others. The sample
included 90 patients aged 16-60 years, with a diagnosis
of treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Patients received a
mean average of 19 sessions of CBT or befriending over
the treatment period. They were randomly allocated to
either treatment condition, making this an independent
groups design. 
Each intervention was delivered by two experienced
nurses. The CBT treatment followed distinct stages,
including engaging with the patient and discussing
the emergence of their disorder, before tackling
specific symptoms. For example, those with auditory
hallucinations engaged in a joint critical analysis with
the nurse to challenge beliefs about the nature and
origin of the voices. Patients kept voice diaries to record
what they were hearing in order to generate
coping strategies.
Participants were assessed by blind raters (meaning
they did not know which condition the participants
were in) before the start of their treatment, at treatment
completion (up to nine months) and at a nine-month
follow-up. They used a number of standardised,
validated assessment scales such as the Comprehensive
Psychiatric Rating Scale (CPRS) and Scale for the
Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). Results
showed that immediately following the treatment
period both groups showed a significant overall
reduction in both positive and negative symptoms of
schizophrenia. At the follow-up stage nine months
later, the improvement in symptoms remained in those
in the CBT condition but was no longer evident in the
befriending condition. Sensky et al. concluded that
CBT is an effective treatment for reducing positive
and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and that the
benefits continue for at least another nine months after
the end of the treatment. See Figure 6.8 for a chart
showing the findings of Sensky et al. 's research.

6 Clinical psychology
Sensky et al. (2000) used a randomised control
trial (RCT) design, which increased validity.
Assessors were blind to the treatment group they
were assessing, which removes any bias they
might have felt for or against the treatment. Also,
since participants were from several different
clinics across the UK, the sample was probably
fairly representative. A further strength was that
the nurses in both conditions were carefully
trained and monitored, which ensured they used
a standardised approach to the CBT. How does
a standardised procedure increase reliability?
ISSUES AND DEBATES
The idiographic versus nomothetic approach can
be applied here. For the most part, research into
treatments takes a nomothetic approach, with
the aim to make generalisations about effective
treatments based on large sets of data. The use
of randomised control trials, such as that carried
out by Sensky et al., allow psychologists to gather
large amounts of data about how effective a
treatment is, compared to a placebo. This takes
a nomothetic approach because the aim is to
find a treatment that is most likely to work for
most people, based on the data available. "
"• diagnostic criteria (ICD-11) of mood disorders: depressive disorder (unipolar) and bipolar disorders
including manic and depressive episodes.

• measure of depression: Beck depression inventory.","6.2 Mood (affective)
disorders: depressive
disorder (unipolar) and
bipolar disorder
Diagnostic criteria
Mood disorders refer to a group of disorders including
bipolar and depressive disorder (sometimes referred
to as unipolar depressive disorder). Mood disorders
are characterised by episodes of particular types of
mood over time. Mood episodes can include depressive,
manic, mixed and hypomanic episodes. Mood episodes
are not diagnosable in their own right but are the main
components of most mood disorders.
Depressive disorder (unipolar)
Depressive disorder is characterised by depressive mood
(feeling sad, irritable or empty) or loss of pleasure. This
will be accompanied by other symptoms that affect
the individual's ability to function, such as difficulty
concentrating, excessive feelings of worthlessness or
guilt, recurrent thoughts of death, or changes to eating
or sleeping patterns. A diagnosis of depressive disorder
can only be made if the individual has never experienced
a manic, mixed or hypomanic episode, as these would
indicate bipolar disorder instead.
Single episode depressive disorder is characterised by
the presence of one depressive episode, without history
of previous episodes. Recurrent depressive disorder is
diagnosed when there are at least two depressive episodes
separated by several months or more without a significant
mood disturbance. A depressive episode is a period of at
least two weeks, during which time there is almost daily
depressed mood or decrease in interest in activities.
Bipolar disorders
There are two types of bipolar disorder: type 1 and
type 2. Both are episodic mood disorders, but they are
distinct from each other due the types of mood
episodes experienced.
• Type 1: defined by the occurrence of at least
one manic or mixed episode. A manic episode
lasts at least one week and is characterised by an
extreme mood - usually feeling euphoric but also
irritable and involves high levels of activity and/
or feelings of increased energy. Individuals will
often show rapid speech, impulsivity, reckless
behaviour and extremely high self-esteem, as well
as rapid changes between mood states. A mixed
episode is characterised by a mixture or rapid
alternating between manic and depressive states on
most days during a two-week period. Most often
manic or mixed episodes alternate with depressive
episodes over time. A depressive episode lasts at
least two weeks and involves depressed mood
or lack of interest in usual activities for most of
the day, nearly every day. Other symptoms may
include changes to sleep and appetite; feelings of
worthlessness, guilt or hopelessness; difficulties
concentrating and suicidal thoughts.
KEYWORDS
episodic mood disorder: a condition
characterised by episodes of time where mood is
either very low or very high
manic episode: a period of at least week where
mood is extremely high
mixed episode: a period of two weeks where
there is a mixture of manic and depressive states
depressive episode: a period of at least two
weeks, which involves depressed mood or lack
of interest in usual activities for most of the day,
nearly every day
hypomanic episode: a less extreme version of
a manic episode, which involves several days of
persistent elevated mood or increased irritability
• Type 2: defined by the occurrence of one or more
hypomanic episodes and at least one depressive
episode. A hypomanic episode is a less extreme
version of a manic episode and involves several
days of persistent elevated mood or increased
irritability, along with increased activity or
increased energy levels. Behaviours shown will be
lesser versions of those in a manic episode, for
example increased talkativeness, increased selfesteem and impulsivity. These behaviours will be
significantly different to the individual's usual
behaviour but will not cause marked impairment
to functioning. There is no history of manic or
mixed episodes. 
Measures: Beck Depression Inventory
One way that depressive disorder is commonly measured
by healthcare professionals is through psychometric
testing. A good example of this is the Beck Depression
Inventory (BDI). This 21-item self-report measure
assesses attitudes and symptoms of depressive disorder
and is one of the most widely used tools for detecting
depressive disorder. Each item in the inventory consists
of at least four statements, and the person taking the
test must choose the one statement that best fits how
they have been feeling during a recent period of time.
This may be the past week or two weeks, depending on
the version of the test that is being used. An example
item is given here (Beck, 1979, page 398), with the
corresponding score listed in brackets:
I get as much satisfaction out of things as I used to (0)
I don't enjoy things the way I used to ( 1)
I don't get real satisfaction out of anything anymore (2)
I am dissatisfied and bored with everything ( 3)
KEYWORD
psychometric testing: a method of measuring
personality traits, emotional states or other
experiences by using sets of questions and
numerical scales
Other items relate to the known symptoms of
depressive disorder; feelings of guilt and hopelessness
and physiological symptoms such as fatigue and
weight loss. The total score across the test is used to
determine the severity of the disorder, with a score of
10 being the minimum for diagnosing mild depression,
19-29 moderate depression and a score or 30 or more
indicating severe depression.
Since its initial introduction, this influential tool has
been updated twice. The current version BDI-II was
issued in 1996 and, while retaining the same structure as
the original, has been revised to include the symptoms
of increase of appetite, loss of appetite and fatigue.
ACTIVITY 6.3
Imagine you are designing a new measure of
depressive symptoms. Using your knowledge
of depressive disorder, and the BDI to help you,
come up with five items that you would include
in your measure.
6 Clinical psychology
The BDI is a robust instrument; numerous studies
have demonstrated that it has high levels of
reliability and validity. This means it is fairly
accurate and consistent in measuring the severity
of an individual's level of depressive disorder.
It is a quantitative measurement, as it provides
a numerical score for each person. This gives it
a level of objectivity that could not be achieved
through an unstructured interview. Although it
cannot capture the detail and richness that a less
structured approach would offer, it is a tool that
allows clinicians treating those with depressive
disorder to measure improvement or deterioration
of their condition over time or with treatments.
However, as a self-report, there is a risk that
validity may be reduced as the person taking the
test may either exaggerate or play down
their symptoms.
ISSUES AND DEBATES
One relevant issue here is that of cultural
differences. A measure, such as the BDI, that has
been devised in one culture cannot necessarily
be used appropriately in other cultures. Most
assessment tools such as the BDI are created in
Western cultures, by Western researchers and
are tested on Western participants. If they are
then used to gather information from people in
different cultures this may decrease the validity of
the measure as it may not have the same meaning
in different cultures. Symptoms of depressive
disorder may vary between cultures, and so may
the language used to describe these symptoms.
Therefore, the measure used to assess depressive
disorder should account for these differences. "

Biological
Biochemical
Brain chemistry is concerned primarily with levels of
different neurotransmitters in the brain. There isn't
just one neurotransmitter that can be attributed to
depressive disorder; it is very complex, and several
neurotransmitters have been identified as being
associated with depressive disorder. Two of the main
ones are dopamine and serotonin.
Dopamine carries signals in parts of the brain
responsible for, among other things, feelings of
motivation and pleasure. So, it makes sense that if levels
of dopamine are reduced, feelings of motivation and
pleasure would be affected. As we know, core symptoms
of depressive disorder are low mood, lack of interest
or enjoyment in usual activities and lack of motivation.
Research shows that low levels of dopamine are often
found in those suffering from depressive disorder.
Furthermore, anti-depressants reduce symptoms of
depressive disorder by increasing dopamine levels, which
supports the theory that low dopamine levels were the
cause of the depressive symptoms.
Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that regulates sleep and
appetite as well as mood and anxiety. When serotonin
levels are normal, mood and anxiety levels are balanced.
However, when serotonin levels reduce, this can lead to
low mood, anxiety and disruption to sleeping and eating
patterns, which are all symptoms of depressive disorder.
Evidence for the role of serotonin in depressive disorder
comes from the fact that the most common antidepressants are SSRis (see the text on 'treatment and
management' in Section 6.2), which work by increasing
serotonin levels.
Genetic
First-degree relatives such as parents and siblings share
50% of their DNA. Just like physical illnesses, some
mental disorders are thought to have a genetic basis,
meaning they can be transmitted from one generation
to the next. Current evidence for bipolar and depressive
disorder suggests that there is at least some genetic
explanation for why some individuals are more at risk
of developing such disorders.

and 5-HT transporter genes in bipolar disorder.
American journal of medical genetics, 74(5), 504-506.
Context
As with other psychological disorders, the cause
of bipolar is very complex. There is thought to
be a combination of biological and psychological
factors associated with the onset of bipolar disorder.
Psychological triggers may include a traumatic event,
such as a breakdown of a relationship or death of
a loved one, or other environmental factors such
as physical illness or sleep disturbances. Biological
explanations focus primarily on brain chemistry
and genetics. If levels of certain neurotransmitters
in the brain are too high or too low this can
lead to a psychological disorder. For example,
serotonin dopamine and noradrenaline are three
neurotransmitters thought to be associated with bipolar
disorder. Previous research has shown that genetics is at
least partly responsible for the development of bipolar
disorder. However, research to try to identify specific
genes that are responsible for bipolar disorder is very
difficult due to the complex inheritance patterns and the
difficulties in precise diagnoses (McGuffin et al., 1994).
Main theories and explanations
Bipolar disorder is thought to be one of the most likely
psychological disorders to be inherited. Genetic factors
are considered to account for up to 80% of the cause of
bipolar disorder. However, there is little understanding
about the specific genes that are associated. One way
of trying to identify which genes are associated with
a disorder is to look at the neurotransmitters that are
involved with the disorder and working back from there.
In the case of bipolar disorder, we know that dopamine,
noradrenaline and serotonin are all neurotransmitters
that are associated with the onset. In order to look at
which genes may be involved in the onset of bipolar,
therefore, we can look at genes that are involved in
these biochemical pathways in the brain. Specifically
then, the suggestion is that, if lower serotonin activity is
implicated in the origin of bipolar disorder, it is a logical
step to investigate the genetic factors that are involved in
serotonin levels.
Aims
The aim of the research is to investigate whether the
genes encoding for certain serotonin receptors and
serotonin transporters could be involved in susceptibility
to bipolar disorder. 
Design
Forty-two unrelated patients with bipolar disorder type
1 from two Croatian hospitals were recruited. There
were 25 females and 17 males, with an age range of
31-70 years. Sixteen of these patients had a first-degree
relative who had been diagnosed with a major affective
disorder such as bipolar disorder. This information was
collected from participants and their family members,
with diagnosis confirmed through medical records.
There was a control group of 40 participants, with no
personal or family psychiatric history. A matched pairs
design was used: where participants in the control group
matched the patient sample in terms of age and sex.
DNA testing was carried out with participants to test
for polymorphisms (variations) in the genes responsible
for a particular serotonin receptor and serotonin
transporter. These genes were chosen because alterations
in them can lead to disturbances in specific biochemical
pathways with known links to depressive disorders. The
results of the DNA analysis were compared between
participants to look for significant factors.
Results, findings and conclusions
Results of the testing showed that there were no
significant associations in the sample. This means
that participants with bipolar were not significantly
more likely to have polymorphisms of the genes under
investigation than the control group. It also means
that those with a family history of mood disorder
were no more likely to have polymorphisms in these
genes than other participants. However, serotonin as a
neurotransmitter is understood to be sexually dimorphic
(there are differences between men and women). So,
when participants were analysed separately by gender,
results showed that polymorphisms for both genes
were more common in women with bipolar than
in the control group. This analysis suggested that
polymorphisms in these genes could be responsible
for an increased risk of developing bipolar disorder in
females only.

6 Clinical psychology
Evaluation
The study by Orne et al. (1997) is limited in terms of
its sample size, meaning it is difficult to generalise from
the results. Typically, genetic studies require fairly
large samples for accurate and valid analysis to take
place. Establishing the importance of the serotoninrelated genes in increasing risk of depressive illness in
females would require a larger sample. Furthermore, the
researchers pointed out that some participants in the
control group were still young enough that they could be
susceptible to bipolar disorder but it has not developed
yet. This means the findings might have changed if the
researchers had used an older population and so age is
an extraneous variable. A strength of the study is that
it collected DNA samples which were analysed in a
laboratory setting with automated equipment, which
increases the validity of the measurement and removes
researcher bias.
Application to everyday life should be considered
in relation to Orne et al.'s study. Any research that
helps develop our understanding of the causes of
psychological disorders is really significant because the
more we understand about the causes the more that
can be done to help those at risk. Understanding that
there may be a genetic influence in the onset of bipolar
disorder means that family members of someone who
has been diagnosed with the disorder could be screened
or offered advice and guidance on signs to look for, and
positive steps to take.
The Orne et al. (1997) study raises the determinism
versus free will debate, since it investigates the influence
of genes and we cannot change our DNA. It suggests
that individuals with a family history of bipolar disorder
are at a greater risk of developing a similar disorder.
This removes the impact of free will, and the idea that
we have some control over the decisions we make and
the circumstances in our lives. However, in this case,
the findings of Orne et al. suggest only a small genetic
susceptibility for females; this indicates there must be
other causes of the disorder, which may or may not be
genetic in origin.
Psychological
Beck's cognitive theory of depression
Cognitive theorists such as Beck (1979) believe that the
negative views held by someone with depression form
a reality for that person, even if they seem far-fetched
to others. The reason for the individual's low mood and
197 > 
) CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL AS & A LEVEL PSYCHOLOGY: COURSEBOOK
physiological symptoms is an underlying process of
incorrect information processing.
Another term for this irrational thinking is 'cognitive
distortion'. According to Beck, cognitive distortion
is when a person tends to see things in a negative way
(a negative bias). This develops as a result of negative
experiences during childhood, leading to negative
schemas. When faced with events or experiences
throughout their life, the person's negative schema is
'activated' (their bias affects their processing) and they
expect things to turn out badly. The result of cognitive
distortion is the emotional, cognitive and behavioural
symptoms typical of depressive disorder.
KEY WORD
schemas: units of knowledge about the world. As
we grow and learn, information from our senses
is arranged meaningfully in our minds; it helps us
to categorise new experiences and details. Our
individual systems of schema underlie virtually
all cognition, such as reasoning, memory and
perception
Cognitive processes involved in depressive disorder can
be understood to form a triad, as seen in Figure 6.9.
Negative views about
the world
I Everybody hates
me because I am
worthless
Negative views about
oneself
Negative views about
the future
I am worthless
Figure 6. 9: Beck's cognitive triad
I'll never be good at
anything because
everyone hates me
The first component of this model relates to the
individual's view of themselves. Unpleasant experiences
are attributed internally, meaning that the individual
thinks that they are worthless and not capable of being
happy. Second, the individual perceives the world as
presenting them with insurmountable obstacles to
happiness and well-being. They misinterpret external
forces as being against them. The third component
198 )
is a negative view of the future; when considering
undertaking a specific task in future, the person
anticipates failure or rejection.
Learned helplessness and attribution style
Learned helplessness was developed by Seligman and
his colleagues in the 1960s. Learned helplessness is
a state that occurs as a result of a person having to
endure an unpleasant situation when they perceive
the unpleasantness to be inescapable. In theory, the
individual learns that they are unable to control the
situation and prevent suffering, so they eventually
stop trying to resist it. Seligman believed that learned
helplessness could explain depressive disorder. His
view was that depression was a direct result of a real
or perceived lack of control over the outcome of
your situation.
Learned helplessness is the basis of 'attributional style'
or 'explanatory style'. As life experiences teach us to
develop trust or distrust in our environments so we
develop particular patterns of thinking towa;ds the
world and ourselves. A person who has had a difficult
upbringing, or experienced parental loss, for example,
might be more likely to perceive a lack of control over
the negative events in their lives (learned helplessness),
and subsequently be more inclined towards a negative
attributional style. This means they will consistently
view things that happen in the future as internal, stable
and global. If something bad happens they might think
it is their fault (internal), or that it will stay this bad
forever (stable) and that it means more things are likely
to go wrong now (global).
KEYWORD
attribution: the cognitive process by which
individuals explain the causes of behaviour
and events. Our attributions may be faulty or
biased: tending to always look to specific causes
for behaviour on the basis of our previous
life experience
Example study
Seligman et al. (1988) investigated how well attributional
style could predict depressive symptoms. Thirty-nine
patients with depressive disorder (unipolar) and
12 patients with bipolar disorder participated in the
study during a depressive episode. All the participants
came from the same outpatient clinic, included a mix
of genders, and had a mean age of 36 years. They 
were compared with a non-clinical control group of
ten participants. At the start of the study, participants
completed a short form of the BDI to assess severity
of symptoms. They then completed an Attributional
Style Questionnaire consisting of 12 hypothetical good
and bad events. The participants had to make causal
attributions for each one (they needed to say what or
who they think was responsible for the event) and then
rate each cause on a seven-point scale for internality,
stability and globality.
Both the bipolar and unipolar participants were found
to have more pessimistic, negative attributional styles
than the non-patient control group. This means they
tended to attribute more of the negative events to
themselves (internality), tended to view negative things
as being more permanent (stability) and tended to see
negative things as affecting many areas of their life
(global). The more severe the depression score on the
BDI, the worse the pessimism on the Attributional
Style Questionnaire. For those with unipolar depressive
disorder undergoing cognitive therapy, an improvement
in attributional style correlated with an improvement
in BDI scores. This suggests that the way we make
attributions is an important mechanism underlying the
experience of unipolar depressive disorder.
Seligman et al. (1988) used standardised
questionnaires to assess participants. The
Attributional Style Questionnaire and BDI are
considered to be valid and reliable measurement
tools. However, the link between BDI and
positivity of attribution was correlational, meaning
it is impossible to determine cause and effect in
this research. Rather than, as Seligman suggests,
attributional style predicting symptoms, it
could be that an improvement in symptoms
could predict a change in attributional style.
Alternatively, there could be a third factor (such
~
s an effective treatment) that influences both
ttributional style and BDI score.

6 Clinical psychology
ISSUES AND DEBATES
The biological explanation for mood disorders
reflects the influence of nature in the nature
versus nurture debate. As particular genes and
biochemicals are implicated in developing these
illnesses, biology is seen as the primary cause.
One example of this is the study by Oruc et al.,
which showed a possible genetic cause for
bipolar disorder in the female population. This,
however, ignores the nurture side of the nature
versus nurture debate, which instead suggests
environmental causes for mood disorders such
as adverse life events or learned helplessness.
Although these explanations are often thought to
be opposing, it is perhaps sensible to look at how
the explanations interact. Someone may inherit
a genetic predisposition to a mood disorder
but this may only develop if it is triggered by an
environmental influence such as a traumatic event"

Biological
There are numerous biochemical treatments for
depressive disorder. As a group they are commonly
known as anti-depressant drugs. Each works in slightly
different ways, though they have a similar effect on
particular neurotransmitter levels in the brain.
Tricyclics were first introduced in the 1950s and are
still used today, although usually only when other
treatments have failed. Tricyclics increase levels of
200)
serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain by stopping
them from being reabsorbed. The increase in levels of
these neurotransmitters reduces symptoms of depressive
disorder. Tricyclics are effective when compared to other
anti-depressants but tend to have more side effects than
more modern alternatives such as SSRis. Side effects
of tricyclics include drowsiness, nausea and vomiting,
blurred vision and weight gain.
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOis) inhibit the
work of an enzyme known as monoamine oxidase.
This enzyme is responsible for breaking down and
removing the neurotransmitters norepinephrine,
serotonin and dopamine. Thus, MAOis prevent these
neurotransmitters from being broken down, and allow
them to remain at higher levels in the brain. There has
been evidence from as early as the 1950s that MAOis are
effective. However, they have numerous side effects such
as headaches, drowsiness/insomnia, nausea, diarrhoea
and constipation. This type of anti-depressant can cause
patients issues with withdrawal. MAO Is may interact
with other medications, such as pain medications and
other anti-depressants, which may lead to negative
side effects such as high blood pressure or headaches.
For this reason, MAO Is now tend to be used to treat
depressive disorder only when other anti-depressants
or treatments have been unsuccessful.
KEY WORDS
inhibit: to hinder or prevent. In neuropsychology,
inhibition occurs when a chemical or chemical
process is reduced or stopped
withdrawal: the physical or mental negative
effects on a person when they stop taking or
reduce some medications. Symptoms can be
relatively mild or can be severe
More recently developed anti-depressants include the
group known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRis). SSRis act on the neurotransmitter serotonin
to stop it being reabsorbed and broken down once it
has crossed a synapse in the brain. This means that
serotonin levels in the brain are increased, which reduces
the symptoms of depressive disorder. SSRis are now the
most commonly prescribed anti-depressant drug in most
countries. They tend to have fewer and less severe side
effects than MAO Is and tricyclics, although different
individuals may respond better to particular drugs. 
Having fewer side effects is important both because it
will improve the quality of life for patients and because
side effects can lead to patients stopping their treatment.
Therefore, drug therapy with fewer side effects means
patients are more likely to continue their treatment and
so the drugs will be more likely to be effective.
Numerous large clinical studies have provided evidence
that tricyclics, MAOis and SSRis are more effective
treatment for depressive disorder than placebos.
However, there is growing evidence to suggest that
the impact of these drugs on individuals is far
more noticeable in patients with moderate to severe
symptoms, and less so in patients diagnosed with mild
depressive disorder (Fournier et al., 2010).
Psychological
Beck's cognitive restructuring
Cognitive restructuring aims to gain 'entry into the
patient's cognitive organisation' (Beck, 1979). It is
essentially a talking therapy, based on one-to-one
interactions between the patient with depressive disorder
and their therapist. It involves techniques, such as
questioning, to identify illogical thinking, and talking
through ways of changing the patient's way of thinking.
Cognitive restructuring as a form of therapy begins
with explaining the theory of depressive disorder to
the patient (see the text on Beck's cognitive theory
of depression in Section 6.2). The explanation of the
triad is an important part of therapy as it enables the
patient to understand that their way of thinking about
themselves and the world contributes to their depressive
disorder. A further stage is to train the patient to
observe and record their thoughts; this is critical for
helping them to recognise irrational or inaccurate beliefs
and statements.
Once the individual can recognise their own cognitions,
the therapist helps them to understand the link between
their thoughts, affect and behaviour, and how each
influences the others. The patient is often directed to try
to 'catch' automatic, dysfunctional thoughts and record
them. This is practised outside therapy sessions, to help
them identify such thoughts as they occur in a real-life
context. Such thoughts can be discussed and challenged
in therapy, to explore with the patient whether they
really are an accurate reflection of reality.
6 Clinical psychology
The purpose of this 'reality testing' for patients is to
investigate and begin to notice negative distortions in
thinking for themselves. The therapist can then use
techniques such as 'reattributing' where they discuss
whether the cause of problems or failures the patient
has experienced are internal or external. As a result of
this, the patient can reframe their thinking about an
upsetting situation and perhaps realise that they were
not responsible for it. Ideally, the therapy finishes when
the patient is able to employ cognitive restructuring for
themselves and can see a reduction in their depressive
symptoms.
Cognitive therapy is now a well-established way to
manage depressive disorder, particularly in cases where
drug treatment is unsuitable. Wiles et al. (2013) showed
that it can reduce symptoms of depression in people
who fail to respond to anti-depressants. A group of
469 individuals with depressive disorder were randomly
allocated either continued usual care (including ongoing anti-depressants) or care with CBT. Those who
received the therapy were three times more likely to
respond to treatment and experience a reduction
in symptoms.
Ellis's rational emotive behaviour therapy (REBT)
Rational emotive behavioural therapy (REBT) is a
psychological approach to treatment based on the
principles of stoicism. Stoicism is a philosophy, and one
of the principles is that in most cases, an individual is
not directly affected by external things but by their own
perception of external things. Albert Ellis (1962) placed
this belief at the core of his theory on how depressive
disorder should be recognised and treated. He argued
that a person becomes depressed because of internal
constructions; because of their perceptions and attitudes
towards things that happen to them in their lives.

problems
C Consequences Emotional and behavioural responses, Feeling sad, tearful, or angry
resulting from beliefs
Table 6.2: The ABC model of psychological change
In REBT, the therapist helps individuals to understand
the process known as the ABC model (see Table 6.2).
The most important element of the model is 'B', one's
beliefs about the event. This is because, while we all
experience adversity and setbacks to some degree, Ellis
argues that it is how we think about those experiences
that have greatest impact on our emotional well-being
and behavioural outcomes. People who consistently
develop negative, fixed or irrational beliefs are at greater
risk of depressive disorder.
The goal of therapy therefore is to help individuals
create and maintain constructive, rational patterns
of thinking about their lives. This means identifying
and changing thoughts which lead to guilt, self-defeat
and self-pity, or negative behaviour such as avoidance,
withdrawal and addiction. The main way this is
achieved is through a process known as 'disputing'. The
REBT therapist forcefully questions irrational beliefs
using a variety of different methods to reformulate
dysfunctional beliefs.
Thus, the therapist enables the individual to recognise
that whatever setbacks they might experience, they can
choose how they think and feel about it. Individuals
must begin to see that the consequences (C) they
experience are only partly a result of an activating event
(A). They then must accept that holding on to negative
and self-defeating beliefs (B) is a destructive tendency,
but one that can be changed by challenging the beliefs
and replacing them with healthier thoughts. Ellis argues
that the tendency to hold on to irrational and unhealthy
beliefs is ingrained in people over time, and so REBT
has a great focus on the present, with little concern for
exploring past experiences (as psychoanalysis would do).
Lyons and Woods (1991) conducted a meta-analysis of
70 REBT outcome studies. They examined a total of

236 comparisons of REBT to baseline, control groups
or other psychotherapies. They found that individuals

over baseline measures and control groups. Recent

are equally effective in relieving symptoms of depressive
disorder (Iftene et al., 2015).
KEYWORD
meta-analysis: data from a range of studies into
the same subject are combined and analysed to
get an overall understanding of the trends
Studies in this section investigating the
effectiveness of anti-depressants such as tricyclics,
MAOls and SSRls consist of generally wellcontrolled experimental research using large
samples, which is highly replicable. Similarly,
research considering the use of cognitive therapy
and REBT such as Wiles et al. (2013), Lyons and
Woods (1991) and lftene et al. (2015) also include
the use of control groups. This increases the
validity as it allows researchers to be confident
in identifying cause and effect. For example,
Lyons and Woods assessed results between
those receiving REBT and the control group
who did not receive the therapy. In what ways
would a case study be a useful way of measuring
the effectiveness of treatments of depressive
disorder? 
ISSUES AND DEBATES
Individual versus situational explanations are
highly relevant to this topic. All the forms of
treatment outlined in this section focus on the
individual's requirements. For example, the
individual is considered to have problematic
levels of neurotransmitters that require correction
through anti-depressant usage, or irrational
thinking that needs to be challenged. Little
consideration is given to changing situational
factors that may contribute to depressive disorder,
such as trying to alleviate social isolation.
Biological versus psychological treatments is a
really important consideration for all psychological
disorders. There is usually some form of drug
treatment and some form of psychological
therapy for any disorder; in this case there are
a range of different anti-depressants (biological
treatments) and cognitive restructuring and
REBT (psychological treatments). Biological
treatments are beneficial because, compared
to psychological treatments, they are cheaper,
work more quickly and are easier for the patient
and whoever is administering the treatment. This
makes them a good option for treatment, usually
at least in the first instance. However, almost all
drug therapies can have side effects, which can
be mild to severe. Although this is not pleasant
for patients taking them, the main problem is
that, if the side effects are unpleasant enough, the
patient may decide to stop taking the medication.
This will of course mean that they cannot work
effectively, and symptoms are likely to return.
Psychological therapies, in contrast, are more
time-consuming and expensive, and do require
the patient's effort and participation. However,
when psychological treatments are effective the
benefits are great; the results tend to be longlasting as they tend to deal with the actual cause
of the problem, and what is learned can be used
again at a later date if necessary. In addition, there
are of course no side effects and in fact having
taken part in psychological therapy can have a
positive impact on the patient's self-esteem and
outlook. "

disorders
Diagnostic criteria
According to the ICD-11, impulse control disorders
are characterised by the repeated inability to resist the
impulse or urge to carry out a behaviour. This behaviour
will feel rewarding to the person in the short-term but
will have long-term negative consequences such as harm
to themselves or others, distress about the behaviour
or significant impairment to some aspect of their life
such as their family, friendships or work life. There are
a range of different impulse control disorders, each
with specific behaviours. We will look at kleptomania,
pyromania and gambling disorder.
Kleptomania is characterised by a powerful impulse to
steal (see Figure 6.10). This impulse is very hard to resist
and the person will often steal things as a result. Before

theft occurs, there is an intense feeling of tension or
affective arousal and, during or immediately following
the theft, there are feelings of excitement, gratification or
relief. The stealing is not intended to achieve any motive
such as for monetary gain and for a diagnosis to be made
there must not be another obvious explanation for the
behaviours, such as any other behavioural or mental
disorder, substance use or intellectual impairment.

Pyromania is characterised by a powerful impulse to set
fires ( see Figure 6 .11). This impulse is very hard to resist,
which results in many acts of, or attempts at, setting
fire to property or other objects. An increasing sense of
tension occurs directly prior to fire-setting and a sense
of pleasure, excitement or gratification is felt during and
immediately after the act, as well as while witnessing the
effects or participating in the aftermath. Additionally,
there is fascination or preoccupation with fire and
related stimuli, such as watching or building fires, or with
firefighting equipment. There is no intelligible motive such

Gambling disorder involves a pattern of persistent or
recurring gambling behaviour either online or offiine
(see Figure 6.12). It is characterised by:
• impaired control of the gambling in terms of, for
example, length of time spent gambling or how
much money is being spent
• gambling being given priority over other activities
or interests
• gambling continuing or increasing despite negative
consequences.
The gambling results in significant distress or significant
impairment to important areas of functioning such
as family life, friendships or work life. Usually, for a
diagnosis, the gambling behaviour and other features
would be present for at least a year, but this can be for a
shorter duration if all diagnostic requirements are met,
and symptoms are severe.

Measures (Kleptomania Symptom
Assessment Scale)
Diagnosis of these disorders can be made with a
clinician using an appropriate self-report measure. One
such measure for the diagnosis of kleptomania is the
Kleptomania Symptom Assessment Scale (K-SAS).
See Figure 6.13 for an example of the items in
the K-SAS.

on average, how strong were your urges?

6 Clinical psychology
This is an 11-item self-rated scale that measures impulses,
thoughts, feelings and behaviours related to stealing. The
individual taking the assessment is asked to consider the
question in relation to the past seven days. Each item
is rated on a point-based scale, typically 0-4 or 0--5
(0 = no symptoms, 4 or 5 = severe, frequent or enduring
symptoms), with the highest scores reflecting the greatest
severity and duration of symptoms.
The K-SAS has scored well for test-retest
reliability. It has also been compared with other
validated tools such as the Global Assessment
of Functioning Scale and found to have good
concurrent validity. However, it relies on self-report,
which means there could be response bias, as
individuals may feel ashamed of their behaviour
and may under-report symptoms. Nonetheless,
it provides quantitative data, which makes it easy
to compare the outcomes of interventions as we
shall see in the next section

ISSUES AND DEBATES
The idiographic versus nomothetic approach can
be applied to the research we have looked at
into impulse control disorders. Assessment scales
such as K-SAS are designed to gather large
amounts of data and collect an understanding of
universal symptoms and experiences for people
with a particular disorder.
This takes a nomothetic approach with the aim
to make generalisations about symptoms based
on large sets of data. It is important to remember,
however, that symptoms and individual experiences
can vary significantly for those diagnosed with
impulse control disorders so a consideration of an
idiographic approach may be beneficial too. "
"• biological explanation: dopamine.

• psychological explanations:
– behavioural: positive reinforcement
– cognitive: Miller’s feeling-state theory.","Explanations
We considered the function of the neurotransmitter
dopamine in relation to schizophrenia earlier in this
chapter. It has also been linked to impulse control
disorders.
Biological
Dopamine
Dopamine is sometimes referred to as a 'happy'
chemical. This is because its release is triggered by
rewarding stimuli, such as engaging in enjoyable
behaviours. So, when someone with kleptomania steals
something, their reward centres are stimulated and
release dopamine. When these behaviours become
compulsive, however, levels of dopamine in the striatum
are reduced. The striatum is an area of the brain that
is responsible for reward and behavioural control, and
so deficiency in dopamine can lead to the continuation
of compulsions and addictions. The person with
kleptomania will then increasingly engage in stealing
behaviours. This mechanism is otherwise known as
'reward deficiency syndrome' (Comings & Blum, 2000)
and may also explain other forms of addiction.
Kleptomania is a possible side effect of using
synthetic dopamine for treatment of disorders such as
Parkinson's. There is also some evidence that symptoms
of gambling disorder and compulsive shopping emerge
alongside the use of these drugs, which further suggests
a relationship between dopamine and impulse
control disorders.
Psycho log ica I
Behavioural: positive reinforcement
An alternative explanation for these disorders also
relates to the idea of rewards. Rather than a biological
focus, the behavioural approach considers the action
of the person involved in the compulsive behaviour,
whether it is setting fires, shoplifting or gambling. One
behavioural theory that can account for these patterns
of behaviour is 'positive reinforcement'.
Positive reinforcement is one aspect of operant
conditioning. Positive reinforcement occurs when
someone's learned behaviour is a result of previous
trials of that behaviour. Take, for example, a person
who is given a scratch card for their birthday and wins,
which encourages them to buy more scratch cards.
The enjoyment of winning acts as a positive reinforcer
(a reward that increases the likelihood of their repeating
the behaviour).
206 >
You might wonder why gamblers don't stop playing
once they start losing. This can be explained by
the 'schedules of reinforcement' they receive while
gambling. Instead of constant positive reinforcement,
most betting games involve a lot of losing! Some fruit
machines, for example, may pay out only one in every
500 plays. In other words, gambling on a fruit machine
involves partial positive reinforcement: you do not
receive a reward each time. This reduces the chance that
the player will ever feel fully satisfied with their reward,
and means they are much more likely to keep playing in
the mistaken belief that they will make up the money
that they have lost. They believe that the pay out could
happen if they play just one more time, and so on.
KEYWORDS
positive reinforcement: when a behaviour
results in a reward, such as money or attention,
that behaviour is likely to be repeated again
Cognitive: Miller's feeling-state theory
A third explanation for impulse control disorders is the
feeling-state theory. It relies on underlying thoughts
about particular behaviours to explain obsessions.
Miller (2010) uses this cognitive approach to explain
how intense, positive feelings can become linked with
specific behaviours such as gambling. Miller proposes
that impulse control disorders are caused because these
links (between positive feelings and specific behaviours)
form a 'state-dependent memory', which he refers to as
a feeling-state (see Figure 6.14).
Intense desire +
Intense positive
experience +
Figure 6.14: Miller's feeling-state theory
The feeling-state is all the sensations, emotions and
thoughts a person experiences in relation to a particular
event. It can also include physiological arousal
(e.g. increased heart rate, release of adrenaline). It is
this feeling-state composed of the positive emotions
and memory of the behaviour that leads to impulse
control problems. If a person's feeling-state about
starting a fire is 'I am a powerful human being',
combined with the positive emotions, physiological
arousal and memory of setting the fire, then this could
create a compulsion for fire-setting behaviour. 
These feeling-states persist over time and different
circumstances, so even early positive feeling-states
can affect later behaviour. It is also important to note
that normal behaviours that occur in moderation only
become problematic because of fixated, intense feelingstates. Miller argues that an underlying negative thought
or experience is most likely to create the feeling-states
that lead to impulse control disorders. For example,
the person with pyromania who has the feeling-state
'I am powerful' when setting a fire may have underlying
negative beliefs about themselves, such as that they
are weak or unimportant. This makes the feeling-state
achieved during the act of fire-setting highly intense and
desirable. However, further negative beliefs occur when
the behaviour goes out of control, typically because
behaviours such as gambling, stealing and setting fires
have highly negative consequences for the individual and
those around them. Table 6.3 summarises the three sets
of beliefs associated with these disorders.
Belief type Example of belief

Research into brain structure or brain chemistry,
such as dopamine levels, for example research by
Comings and Blum (2000), has many strengths.
The use of brain scans (such as PET scans or
tMRI scans) is scientific and objective; we can
actually see which parts of the brain are active
or not active. It does not rely on subjective
interpretation from the researcher or on self-report
from participants, so this increases the validity of
the research. Technological advances allow us a
much greater understanding of the human brain
and, as a result, of human behaviour, and the
scientific approach allows for high levels of validity
nd reliability. How would psychologists have
vestigated brain changes before brain scans?

ISSUES AND DEBATES
The individual versus situational debate is relevant
to the biological and cognitive explanations,
as the biochemical account of impulse control
explains addiction as relating to individual
impairment of brain function. The cognitive
explanation for impulse control disorders reflects
a more balanced view, considering both individual
and situational factors. For example, some
experiences will be stimulating, rewarding or
upsetting (situational influence), but as individuals
we each develop our own feeling-states in
relation to these, which lead to overall patterns of
behaviour. "

) CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL AS & A LEVEL PSYCHOLOGY: COURSEBOOK
Context
There are a range of different treatments that can be
used to treat people with pathological gambling (PG),
with varying degrees of success. Psychological therapies
such as covert sensitisation and imaginal desensitisation
(see the next section) work by changing the thoughts of
the client, in order to bring about behavioural change.
Drug therapy is a biological treatment that can be used
to treat those with PG. Previous research, such as that
carried out by Kim et al. (2001) has shown that opiate
antagonists can be a successful treatment for (PG).
There are, however, individual differences in responses,
and between 10 and 30% of patients treated with opiate
antagonists do not show significant improvement (Kim
et al. 2001). Although these findings suggest there are
individual differences in the effectiveness of opiate
antagonists as treatment for PG, no previous research
had been carried out to examine predictors to treatment
outcome in PG.
Main theories and explanations
Opiate antagonists are a group of drugs that have
been traditionally used to treat substance abuse. When
someone suffers from substance abuse, the reward
centres in the brain are activated by the drug or alcohol
use, which then makes the person crave the drug or
alcohol more and more. The same happens when
someone with PG engages in gambling behaviour;
the reward centres in their brain are activated. Opiate
antagonists work by reducing the response of the reward
centre in the brain. This reduces the urge to engage in
addictive behaviours, such as gambling and drinking
alcohol, and extends the periods of abstinence (when the
addictive behaviour is not carried out). An example of a
commonly used opiate antagonist is nalmefene.
Opiate antagonists have been shown to be effective
treatments for alcohol dependence, particularly for
people with strong alcohol cravings, a family history of
alcoholism and a euphoric response to alcohol (O'Brien
2005, Monterosso et al., 2001). Alcohol dependence
is genetically linked to PG, and the two often occur
alongside each other.
Aims
The research aimed to identify clinical variables
associated with treatment outcome in PG subjects
receiving opiate antagonists. The researchers
hypothesised that a family history of alcoholism
and stronger urges to gamble would be associated
with positive outcomes for those treated with opiate
208)
antagonists. They also hypothesised that people with less
severe PG would be more likely to respond positively to
a placebo than those with more severe PG.
Design
Two double-blind placebo clinical trials (lasting
16 weeks and 18 weeks) were carried out on 284 patients
with PG who had gambled in the last two weeks.
The sample included an approximately equal number of
men and women; all participants were from the USA.
An independent groups design was used, where
participants in each trial were randomly assigned to
one of four conditions: placebo, or nalmefene doses
of 25 mg/day, 50 mg/day or 100 mg/day in one trial
and, similarly in the other trial: placebo, or naltrexone
(another type of opiate antagonist) doses of 50 mg/
day, 100 mg/day or 150 mg/day. Across both trials,
approximately 25% of the participants were given a
placebo, to act as a control. The trials were double-blind
so neither the participants nor the investigators knew
who was taking the placebo and who was taking the
active drugs (see Figure 6.15).
Clinician-administered scales and semi-structured
interviews were used to gather data. The Yale-Brown
Obsessive Compulsive Sciilc Modified for Pathological
Gambling (PG-YBOCS) was the main measure
used. This is a clinician-administered scale to assess
gambling severity by assessing symptoms over the
previous seven days, in terms of both gambling urges/
thoughts and gambling behaviour. Other scales were
also administered, assessing the participants on
psychological functioning, anxiety and depressive
disorder (unipolar). Semi-structured interviews were
used to gather family history, particularly relating to
first-degree relatives with alcoholism.

Results, findings and conclusions
Treatment response was defined as at least a 35%
reduction in PG-YBOCS total score for at least one
month following treatment. Results showed that the
variable most strongly associated with a positive
response to opiate antagonist treatment was a family
history of alcoholism. This, combined with the
knowledge that opiate antagonists can be an effective
treatment for alcohol dependence, suggests there
may be a genetic influence on the response to opiate
antagonist treatment. For those receiving a higher dose
of opiate antagonists, intensity of gambling urges was
associated with a positive response to treatment. With
those receiving a placebo, younger age was associated
with a more positive response; presumably because the
gambling urges and behaviours were less ingrained than
in older patients so the placebo was more easily able to
work. Contrary to expectations, those with less severe
PG did not respond more positively to placebo.
The researchers concluded that a family history of
alcoholism and strong gambling urges seem to predict
a positive response to opiate antagonists in treatment
of PG. Although further research should be carried out
to investigate whether there are genetic or other specific
factors involved, this is really useful in determining who
may respond best to opiate antagonist treatment.

believing they are receiving real drug treatment. When
a participant is deceived in any way there is an ethical
consideration, particularly if the deception may lead
to distress, embarrassment or any form of harm to the
participant. When using deception in a placebo trial this
means that some of the participants are not receiving
the real drug so there is a risk to their health as they will
not benefit from the treatment. However, before entering
a placebo trial, participants will be informed of the
process and it will be made clear that if they consent to
take part in the trial, they may receive the actual drug or
they may receive the placebo.
The study by Grant et al. (2008) shows application to
everyday life by showing the effectiveness of opiates in
treating individuals with a gambling disorder. It gives
us an idea of which individual circumstances might
make this treatment most effective. This could have a
hugely beneficial impact on the treatment of patients;
by understanding factors that can predict a positive
response to certain treatments this makes it more likely
for a successful treatment to be found more quickly.
Psychological (cognitive-behavioural
therapies)
As we have learned, cognitive and behavioural therapies
may rely on changing distortions in the thoughts and
feelings of clients, in order to bring about behavioural
change. We will discuss two types of therapy that have
been used to treat impulse control disorders: covert
sensitisation and imaginal desensitisation.
Covert sensitisation
The covert sensitisation procedure involves conditioning,
in which an unpleasant stimulus such as nausea or an
anxiety-producing image is paired with an undesirable
behaviour in order to change that behaviour. It therefore
draws on classical conditioning and is Jess concerned
with underlying reasons regarding the origin
of behaviour.
Example study
Glover (1985) describes one case study using covert
sensitisation to treat an instance of kleptomania.
A 56-year-old woman with a 14-year history of daily
shoplifting who was seeking help for her behaviour
took part in this therapy. Her behaviour started after 
> CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL AS & A LEVEL PSYCHOLOGY: COURSEBOOK
her husband was convicted of embezzlement (stealing
money from his workplace). Finding it difficult to
forgive him, the woman had then become isolated
from their close friends, reluctantly taken a low-status
job, and become depressed. Compulsive thoughts of
shoplifting entered her head each morning, which were
repulsive but nonetheless impossible to resist. Her
shoplifting was without purposeful gain. For example,
she once stole baby shoes, despite not having anyone to
give them to.
Glover reports that the woman sought treatment for her
disorder. The treatment involved using the imagery of
nausea and vomiting to create an unpleasant association
with stealing. The woman underwent four sessions
at two-weekly intervals. For the first two sessions,
muscle relaxation was used to enhance her ability to
immerse herself in the visualisation. Increasing nausea
visualisation was used over each session; she imagined
vomiting as she lifted the item to steal and attracting
attention and disgust of those around her. She practised
these visualisations outside the formal sessions as
'homework'. During the last session, she imagined the
sickness going away as she replaced the item and walked
away without shoplifting. The participant learned to
associate the unpleasant sensations of vomiting with the
undesirable stealing behaviour. At a 19-month check-up
she had decreased desire and avoidance of the stealing,
with just a single relapse. Additionally, she reported
improvements in her self-esteem and social life.

Imaginal desensitisation
Imaginal desensitisation therapy relies on the use of
images to help individuals who have specific types of
impulse control disorders, such as gambling disorder
and kleptomania.
Example study
Blaszczynski and Nower (2003) describe imaginal
desensitisation therapy and explore some evidence
of its effectiveness.
First, the therapist teaches a progressive muscle
relaxation procedure, as seen in Figure 6.16. Clients
must then visualise themselves being exposed to a
situation that triggers the drive to carry out their
impulsive behaviour. So, for example, a gambler might
be instructed to imagine they are coming back from
a long, stressful day at work. They are then asked to
think about acting on the impulse to gamble, then to
mentally leave the situation. This should all be done in
a state of continued relaxation, without having acted on
the impulse to gamble. The sessions are often audiorecorded to assist with practising the technique outside
therapy sessions.
Imaginal desensitisation has been found to be effective
in several studies. It has been shown to reduce the
strength of a compulsive drive by reducing levels of
psychological and physiological arousal associated
with these disorders. In those with gambling disorders,
for example, imaginal desensitisation was found
to significantly decrease arousal and anxiety levels
associated with gambling impulses, even at a five-year
follow-up. Clients who have undertaken the therapy
generally also report that they feel better able to control
their impulses.

The study by Glover (1985) shows how covert
sensitisation can be used effectively to reduce
symptoms of kleptomania over several months.
However, this research is a case study, meaning
it cannot be generalised to a larger number
of people. Also, as the study is about an
individual with kleptomania, we cannot be sure
the improvements would be as good for other
impulse control disorders.
Furthermore, the follow-up interview with the
participant occurred within a year post-treatment;
a longer-term review could check for relapses in
behaviour. Also, it is the therapist who is assessing
the participants, meaning they may be biased
in reporting improvements as a result. However,
the main strength of this study is that it allows for
the collection of in-depth qualitative data that
help us understand the experience of the person
undergoing treatment.
ISSUES AND DEBATES
The treatments we have explored in this section
can be applied to everyday life. In addition to
the key study by Grant et al. investigating the
effectiveness of opiates, the cognitive-behavioural
treatments we have explored can be used in
conjunction with drug therapy or to improve
the symptoms of those with treatment-resistant
impulse control disorders. How could the nature
versus nurture debate be applied to treatments
of impulse control disorders?"

fear-related disorders
Diagnostic criteria
Anxiety disorders and fear-related disorders are
characterised by excessive fear and anxiety and related
disturbances to behaviour. Symptoms are severe enough
to result in significant distress or to significantly impair
one or more important areas of functioning, such as
family, social or occupational. The distinction between
fear and anxiety is important: fear is a response to
perceived imminent threat in the present, whereas
anxiety is more focused on perceived anticipated threat
in the future. Anxiety and fear-related disorders are
usually differentiated by the specific stimulus that
triggers the fear or anxiety. We will look at the ICD-11
criteria for three such disorders: generalised anxiety
disorder, agoraphobia and specific phobia (bloodinjection-injury (BII)).
Generalised anxiety disorder (see Figure 6.17) is
characterised by marked symptoms of anxiety for
the majority of days, over a period of at least several
months. The anxiety may be a general feeling of
apprehension or may be worry focused on multiple
everyday events such as health, family, finances or work.
Related symptoms such as muscular tension, sleep
disturbance, difficulty concentrating, or irritability may
also present. Symptoms result in significant distress or
significant impairment in one or more important areas
of functioning such as family, social or occupational.
For a diagnosis to be made the symptoms must not
211 ) 
) CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL AS & A LEVEL PSYCHOLOGY: COURSEBOOK
be due to another medical condition or the effect of
substance or medication.
Figure 6.17: Generalised anxiety disorder is characterised
by marked symptoms of anxiety over a period of several
months or more
Agoraphobia is characterised by excessive fear or anxiety
in response to situations where escape might be difficult
or help might not be available, such as using public
transport, being in crowds or being outside the home
alone (see Figure 6.18). The person will be afraid of
having specific negative outcomes, such as panic attacks
or other embarrassing symptoms in a public place.
When possible, these situations are actively avoided and
only entered under specific circumstances or endured
with extreme distress. The symptoms persist for several
months and are severe enough to result in significant
distress or significant impairment to one or more
important areas of functioning.
Figure 6.18: Agoraphobia involves excessive fear or
anxiety such as when in a crowded place
212 )
Specific phobia (BII) is characterised by excessive
fear or anxiety that occurs consistently when exposed
to, or in anticipation of, a specific stimulus: in this
case, the exposure to or anticipation of the sight of
blood, injection or injury. The fear or anxiety will be
disproportionate to the actual danger and the phobic
stimulus will be avoided where possible or endured with
intense fear or anxiety. The symptoms persist for several
months and are severe enough to result in significant
distress or significant impairment to one or more
important areas of functioning.
Measures
The Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7)
Questionnaire is a screening test often used to enable
further referral to a psychiatrist or counsellor. It has
seven items that measure the severity of anxiety. These
include 'Feeling nervous, anxious or on edge', 'Being so
restless that it is hard to sit still' and 'Feeling afraid as
if something awful might happen'. Similar to the Blood
Injection Phobia Inventory (BIPI), individuals are
asked to provide a score between O and 3 for each item;
however, in this test the scores refer to the frequency of
occurrence of symptoms (0 = not at all, 1 = several days,
2 = more than half the days and 3 = nearly every day).
This tool is typically used by general practitioners and
in primary care settings rather than by specialists. As
such, it can be described as a screening tool, useful for
recommending further referral rather than providing the
level of detail needed for a formal diagnosis.
The Blood Injection Phobia Inventory (BIPI)
The Blood Injection Phobia [nventory (BIPI) is a way of
measuring this specific phobia. The self-report measure
lists 18 possible situations involving blood and injections
(see Table 6.4 for an example). For each situation the
individual is asked to evaluate different reactions they
might experience for that situation. These include

are then asked to rate on a scale of 0-3 the frequency

Example study
Mas et al. (2010) carried out research to see whether
the BIPI could discriminate between those diagnosed
with BII phobia and those who were not. They also
wanted to investigate whether blood phobia was a onedimensional construct, or whether it was influenced by
a range of stimuli (such as other medical procedures)
and responses (cognitive, biological and behavioural).
Finally, the research aimed to find out whether the
BIPI could identify a change in people with the phobia,
as a result of therapy. They studied 39 participants
diagnosed with BII phobia and a control group matched
on age and gender. As well as the BIPI, participants
completed the Fear Questionnaire (FQ; Marks &
Matthews, 1979) designed to measure agoraphobic fear,
social anxiety and blood-injection-injury phobia.
Results showed that the BIPI had excellent reliability
and internal consistency as well as good concurrent
validity with the subscale of blood phobia of the FQ.
The BIPI also clearly discriminated between those
diagnosed with blood-injury-injection phobia and
those who were not. Finally, the BIPI was found to be
a sensitive tool in identifying therapeutic improvement.
Participants completed the BIPI before and after
undergoing treatment for their phobia and the BIPI
scores indicated a notable reduction in the severity of
the phobia following treatment.
6 Clinical psychology
RESEARCH METHODS
In this section, we have considered two
assessment tools for measuring symptoms of
anxiety and related disorders: the BIPI and the
GAD-7. Both the GAD-7 and the BIPI have been
shown to have good concurrent validity with
other measures, and thus are valid and reliable
instruments for assessing anxiety and blood
phobia respectively (Mas et al., 2010, Spitzer
et al., 2006). However, both measures rely on
the accuracy of the individual's self-reporting of
symptoms. If a person is having a particularly
'bad' day (perhaps they have accidentally cut their
finger that morning), then their BIPI score might
be distorted by this.
Both measurement tools described here can be
considered to be psychometric assessments.
This means they analyse one dimension of a
person's thinking, behaviour and emotions,
e.g. towards blood in the case of the BIPI. This
type of assessment can be controversial; it
relies on a single quantitative measurement of
what is actually a complex and all-consuming
lived experience for individual sufferers. Some
psychologists might feel that these assessments
alone do not tell us enough about what it is like to
have a specific phobia, and how symptoms may
change over time and with treatment.
ISSUES AND DEBATES
Cultural differences can be considered in relation
to methods of measuring psychological disorders.
Many psychological disorders have been found
to have slightly different symptoms for people in
different cultures. There is a concern about the
validity of using the same diagnostic criteria for
people across all cultures. Blood-injury-injection
phobia is a particular example where there may be
cultural differences in people's experiences. The
phobia relates mainly to blood tests and other
similar procedures such as injections, so it may

not have as much relevance in some non-Western
cultures where medical procedures such as this are
rare or not present at all. Similarly, symptoms of
general anxiety disorder and agoraphobia will be
very different for those in some cultures, where,
for example, public transport or busy shopping
centres are not part of everyday life. It is not to say
that these disorders may not be present across all
cultures but that the specific ways they present
may differ between cultures so the measures used
may need to be amended to account for this. "

– psychodynamic, including a study, e.g. Freud (1909) ‘Little Hans’.","Explanations
Biological
Genetic
The genetic explanation suggests that we are born
prepared to fear certain objects. In other words, there
are particular stimuli in the environment that may pose
a threat to survival that we are more genetically set up
to avoid. This is transmitted in our DNA through the
generations to help our survival.
Example study
Ost (1992) carried out a study included 81 individuals
with blood phobia and 59 individuals with injection
phobia. These were also compared with a sample
of other participants who had been diagnosed with
different specific phobias, such as animal, dental and
claustrophobia (fear of small spaces). Participants
underwent a screening interview with a clinician and
completed a self-report questionnaire on the history
and nature of their phobia.This included discussing the
impact the phobia had on their normal lives, as well as
giving ratings to particular situations that might trigger
a fearful response.
Participants also underwent a behavioural test. Those
with blood phobia were shown a 30-minute silent colour
video of surgery being performed. They were told not
to close their eyes but to try to watch for as long as they
felt they could. The experimenter tracked gaze direction
and if participants looked away or stopped the video
using a remote control, the test would be terminated.
The injection phobic test was 'live' and involved 20
steps, from the individual's fingertip being cleaned, to
214 )
having a fingertip prick performed on them. Each step
was described to the subjects, who had to say whether
or not it was OK to perform. If they said 'no' the
test ended.
The measures included a score relating to the percentage
of maximal performance (e.g. how long they watched
the video), the experimenter's rating of the patient's
fainting behaviour (0 = no fainting and 4 = fainting),
and a self-rating of anxiety (0 = not at all anxious and
10 = extremely anxious). Participants also completed a
questionnaire on their thoughts during the test and had
their blood pressure and heart rate monitored. This is
because the fainting associated with these phobias has
been found to be related to changes in blood pressure
and heart rate.
The family histories of participants revealed that around
50% of those with blood phobia had one or more
parents who also had blood phobia. Similarly, for those
with injection phobia, 27% had at least one parent who
has also had injection phobia. Around 21 % of those
with blood phobia also reported having at least one
sibling who shared the disorder. Another key finding of
this study is that a high proportion of the participants
with blood phobia and injection phobia had a history of
fainting when exposed to their respective phobic stimuli
(70% of those with blood phobia and 56% of those with
injection phobia). These results are much higher than
those participants with other specific phobias or anxiety.
Ost concluded that there seemed to be a strong genetic
link for these phobias, which are more likely than
other phobias to produce a strong physiological
response (fainting).
Psychological
Behavioural including classical and operant
conditioning
One behavioural explanation for phobias is based on
classical conditioning. An individual may develop a
phobia of a harmless stimulus if it is paired with a
frightening experience. For example, a person might
develop agoraphobia following an assault or mugging
(being a victim of robbery) in public.
In what is now thought to be a controversial study,
Watson and Rayner (1920) used the principles of
classical conditioning to create a phobia in a young
boy. A normal, healthy 9-month-old infant known as
'Little Albert' was the participant in their case study
(see Figure 6.19). 
Figure 6.19: Little Albert was the subject of Watson and
Rayner's case study into classical conditioning and phobias
Prior to the conditioning, he was shown a range of
different stimuli. These included a white rat, a rabbit,
a dog, a monkey, masks with and without hair, cotton
wool, burning newspapers, etc. He reacted normally
and neutrally throughout with no outward signs of
fear. The white rat was chosen as the neutral stimulus
(NS). They also placed a metal bar above and behind
Albert's head and struck it loudly with a hammer. This
was the unconditioned stimulus (UCS) as it produced an
unconditioned response of fear (UCR) in the boy.
The next phase was the conditioning (see Table 6.5).
When Albert was shown the rat, he began to reach for it,
but just as his hand touched the animal the researchers
made a loud noise by striking a hammer against a metal
bar just behind his head. Understandably this made the

infant very distressed. Watson and Rayner repeatedly
paired the loud noise with presentation of the white
rat over several trials one week after the initial trial.
Eventually Albert only had to see the rat and he began to
show a fearful response ( crying, trying to move away from
it). The white rat had become a conditioned stimulus
(CS), producing a conditioned response (CR) of fear.
The researchers wanted to see if Albert's fear of the rat
was generalised to other similar-looking animals or items.
When presented with a rabbit he also had a similarly
distressed reaction. These results suggested that fear
could indeed be learned through classical conditioning.
We have seen how classical conditioning can explain
how a phobia can begin. To understand how phobias
can be maintained, however, we need to look at
another form of conditioning: operant conditioning.
Operant conditioning is based on the principle
of learning through consequences. So, if you are
punished for a behaviour, you will be less likely to
repeat the behaviour. However, if you carry out a
behaviour and you get a reward, you will be likely to
repeat the behaviour again (reinforcement). Negative
reinforcement is an important feature of operant
conditioning and it is this which can best explain how
phobias persist. Negative reinforcement is the increased

likelihood of a behaviour being repeated, due to the
removal of something negative or unpleasant. In terms
of a phobia, the avoidance of the phobic stimulus
reduces the fear, so it is therefore rewarding, and the
avoidant behaviour will be repeated. This leads to a
continuation of the phobia because, by avoiding the
stimulus you are not allowing yourself the opportunity
to see that there is little to fear. For example, an
individual develops a phobia of ducks after being
chased by a duck (thus forming an association
through classical conditioning). As a result, the person
avoids parks, farms, etc. where ducks are most likely
to be encountered, so that they can avoid the fear
they would feel in the presence of ducks (negative
reinforcement). However, most ducks are not aggressive
or scary so meeting other ducks may act as a way of
counterconditioning and overcoming the phobia. So,
although rewarding in the short-term, the avoidance
behaviour actually allows the phobia to persist.
KEYWORD
counterconditioning: replacing a conditioned
response, such as fear, with another response,
such as a feeling of calm
Psychodynamic
Freud suggested that anxiety and fear can result from
the impulses of the id, usually when it is being denied
or repressed. Phobias are one way this internal conflict
can manifest in human behaviour. According to Freud's
theory of psychosexual stages, such sources of conflict
are common at different times in our development. The
phobic object comes to symbolise the conflict typical of
the stage.
Example study
Freud (1909) offered an account of a boy who was
suffering from a phobia of horses and a range of other
symptoms to illustrate the Oedipus complex. Little
Hans was a five-year-old Austrian boy whose father had
referred the case to Freud and provided most of the case
detail; Hans met Freud no more than twice during the
period of the study (see Figure 6.20).
When he was three, Little Hans had developed an
intense interest in his penis. He frequently played with
himself, which angered his mother who threatened to
cut it off. This upset the boy and he developed a fear
of castration. Around this time, Hans' younger sister
was born, and his mother was separated from him in
hospital. He also witnessed an upsetting incident where
a horse fell and died in the street.
Quite soon after this time, Little Hans' horse phobia
emerged. He was particularly worried that he would be
bitten by a white horse.
Figure 6.20: Little Hans' phobia of horses was the subject
of a case study by Freud
Hans' father felt this concern was related to horses'
large penises. Conflict began to emerge between Hans
and his father, who had begun denying him the chance
to get into his parents' bed in the mornings to sit with
his mother. Hans' phobia lessened as he reached the
age of five. His father reported Hans had experienced
two notable fantasies at this time. One was that he
had several children of his own with his mother and
imagined that his father was in fact his grandfather. He
also fantasised that a plumber had come and removed
his penis and replaced it with a new, larger one.
Freud felt that the object of fear, the horse, represented
Hans' father. Hans was particularly afraid of white
horses with black nosebands, which symbolised his
moustached father. The anxiety Little Hans experienced
was related to his castration fear from his mother's
threat and the banishment of Hans from his parents'
bed. Freud argued that the Oedipus complex was further
supported by the two fantasies, which represented the
dynamic of the three-way relationship between Little
Hans and his parents. 
Ethical considerations should be taken into account
particularly when looking at Watson and Rayner's
study into Little Albert. The fact that Watson and
Rayner's research was carried out on a child means
that ethical issues are particularly important. It
could be argued that Watson and Rayner did not
protect Little Albert from harm. Little Albert was
deliberately and repeatedly exposed to fearful
experiences to create phobias, which would
have lasting damage. However, it is important to
remember that Little Albert's parents consented
for him to take part in the research, with a full
understanding of what was going to take place.
Both the studies by Watson and Rayner (1920)
and Freud (1909) were case studies. This means
we cannot reasonably generalise about the
acquisition of phobias from Little Albert's or
Little Hans' experiences alone. However, Watson
and Rayner conducted a number of trials using
different stimuli to check whether Albert was a
particularly fearful boy and controlled for any
changes that occurred during the study. As
Albert appeared healthy and confident, it may
well be that phobias could be acquired by other
children in the same way. Freud's study lacked
objectivity as he was a friend of Hans' father, who
also provided him with the case study detail. This
research lacks validity as it may be subject to bias
in an attempt to fit Freud's existing theories about
the subconscious and psychosexual stages.
In comparison, the research by Ost could be
considered more objective, because it used
standardised behavioural tests and interviews with
larger groups of participants. His findings could
be generalised more easily and had better levels
of control. However, the study was cross-sectional
and did not consider the different participant's
experiences in depth.
Freud's case study of Little Hans takes into
account Hans' fears, dreams, conversations and
fantasies over a number of years to trace the
origin and resolution of his horse phobia. Use
of longitudinal research in this way can build an
in-depth picture of a participant's experience,
which can help us to get a better understanding
of causal factors in specific phenomenon, such as
the development of phobias.
6 Clinical psychology
ISSUES AND DEBATES
All the explanations we have seen in this section
can be seen to be deterministic. The genetic
explanation suggests that if you have a close
family member with blood phobia you are at
significant risk of developing it yourself. If a
condition is thought to be genetic it suggests that
free will is not involved and that an inheritance of
a certain gene, or combination of genes, will make
you more likely to develop the disorder.
Similarly, the behaviourist and psychodynamic
explanations are also deterministic. The
behaviourist approach suggests that if you are
subject to conditioning where an association
is made between a feared stimulus and a
neutral stimulus, a phobia will develop. The
psychodynamic approach proposes that anxiety
and fear-related disorders develop due to
unresolved conflicts during childhood. Again, this
is deterministic as the suggestion is that if you
experience this unresolved conflict, anxiety or fear
will develop and there is little that can be done to
overcome or avoid it.
It is important to consider that no gene has been
found to be anywhere near 100% predictive of
anxiety or fear-related disorder, that not everyone
who experiences a fearful situation then develops
a phobia and that evidence for unresolved
conflicts during childhood is unscientific and
retrospective so cannot be used to make
predictions or determine the onset of anxiety or
fear-related disorder."

Behavioural therapy: systematic
desensitisation
Systematic desensitisation is a way of reducing
undesirable responses to particular situations. This
makes it a particularly appropriate way of managing
phobias, such as agoraphobia. Its principles are based
within behavioural psychology; it holds the assumption
that nearly all behaviour is a conditioned response to
stimuli in the environment. If a phobia can be learned
as in the case of Little Albert (Watson & Rayner, 1920),
then it can also be unlearned.
217 > 
) CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL AS & A LEVEL PSYCHOLOGY: COURSEBOOK
This is referred to as counterconditioning.
Systematically desensitising a patient requires that a
once frightening stimulus should eventually become
neutral and provoke no real anxiety.
Wolpe (1958) introduced the idea of 'reciprocal
inhibition', which is the impossibility of feeling two
strong and opposing emotions simultaneously. The
key to unlearning phobic reactions through systematic
desensitisation is to put the fearful feelings associated
with a phobic stimulus directly in conflict with feelings
of deep relaxation and calm. A therapist practising
systematic desensitisation follows particular stages that
are outlined next:
• The therapist teaches the patient relaxation
techniques. These can be progressive muscle
relaxation exercises, visualisation or even antianxiety drugs.
•
•
The patient and therapist work together to create
an anxiety hierarchy (see Table 6.6 for an example
relating to agoraphobia). This is a list of anxietyprovoking situations relating to the specific phobia
that increase in severity. The list is unique to the
individual who works through in vitro or in ,,ivo
exposure to each stage in turn. In Table 6.6, the
patient begins with in vitro exposure - imagining the
scenarios - and then moves on to in vivo exposure -
facing the stimuli in real life (see Figure 6.21 ).
At each stage of the anxiety hierarchy, the patient
is assisted to remain in a calm, relaxed state using
their chosen technique. The patient does not move
on to the next stage in the hierarchy until they
report feeling no anxiety in relation to their
current stage.

As the two emotions of fear and calm are incompatible,
the fearful response to the stimuli is gradually unlearned
and will no longer produce anxiety in the patient. There
is good research evidence to support the effectiveness
of systematic desensitisation in treating phobias such as
agoraphobia (Agras, 1967) and fear of snakes (Kimura
et al., 1972). However, since the 1970s and 1980s, this
form of therapy has declined in popularity and other
treatments which involve more direct forms of exposure
are now more commonly used.

cognitive behavioral therapy: an adult case
example. Clinical case studies, 13(4), 299-312.
Context
Existing evidence suggests that CBT can be an effective
treatment of specific phobias, including BII phobia
(Antony et al., 2001). Most phobias can be successfully
treated with a therapeutic approach to reduce the fearresponse in the patient. For most phobias, any physical
symptoms are directly associated with fear (shaking,
sweating, nausea), so once the fear response is treated
the patient is able to face their phobic stimulus.
However, effective treatment of BII phobia is considered
to require more than just a therapeutic approach to
reduce the fear response in the patient. As discussed
previously, BII phobia is associated with an increased
likelihood of fainting when exposed to the phobic
stimulus. Therefore, treatment for BII phobia also
requires the need to teach strategies focusing on staying
conscious instead of fainting when faced with their
feared stimuli.
Main theories and explanations
CBT is an effective treatment for a range of phobias
because it enables the individual to challenge their
irrational thoughts and replace them with more
rational ones. The rational thinking leads to changes
in behavioural and emotional responses, which can be
practised until the phobia is treated.
The introduction of behavioural therapy for anxiety
disorders such as systematic desensitisation paved
the way for further forms of treatment, including
applied tension. This form of treatment involves
applying tension to the muscles, in an effort to increase
blood pressure throughout certain areas. As you may
remember, blood phobia in particular is associated
with lowered blood pressure and fainting. By training
individuals with blood phobia to increase muscle
tension, the aim is to reduce instances of fainting and
other unpleasant responses when exposed to medical
procedures such as phlebotomy (taking blood samples).
6 Clinical psychology
KEYWORD
phlebotomy: the process of taking a sample
of blood
Aims
The aim of this case study was to investigate whether
BII phobia could be successfully treated using CBT and
applied muscle tension.
Design
A case study was used to gather in-depth detail about
one individual, known as 'T'. He was a 42-year-old
white male, diagnosed with BII phobia. The researchers
used interviews to gather a detailed life history from
T, involving information about several challenging
times in his life. These included witnessing the deaths
of several family members, living with a highly anxious
grandmother who used a scanner to listen to emergency
dispatch calls throughout the day, and witnessing
other family members faint during medical procedures.
Questionnaires were also administered, including
measures of anxiety and depression (the Beck Anxiety
Inventory (BAI), the Beck Depression Inventory
(BDI)) and a measure of general satisfaction across
several areas of life (the Quality-of-Life Satisfaction
Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q)). The Blood-Injection
Symptom Scale (BISS) was given to test if T met the
criteria for a diagnosis of BII phobia, which he did.
T was also diagnosed with major depressive disorder
(recurrent, in full remission) based on an episode in
college.
T then underwent nine sessions of CBT and applied
muscle tension. During CBT, T was educated about how
common phobias are and he created a fear hierarchy,
which he worked through. T was introduced to the
Subjective Unit of Discomfort Scale (SUDS), which
was used to give ratings of his anxiety (from 0-100) at
different stages of the hierarchy exposure.
Results, findings and conclusions
Before undergoing treatment, the results of T's selfassessments showed he had severe anxiety, minimal
depressive symptoms, and overall good health in
most areas of life. He showed intense fear and anxiety
surrounding blood and injections. Throughout the
219 ) 
) CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL AS & A LEVEL PSYCHOLOGY: COURSEBOOK
therapy sessions T was able to experience each stage of
his fear hierarchy, without his SUDS becoming too high.
This ended with him having blood taken (SUDS of 40
out of 100 initially, then soon dropping to 'nothing')
with only minimal applied muscle tension used. At 4, 10
and 12 months post-treatment, T reported back on his
progress and, as well as having been to several medical
appointments, results of the self-report measures
showed that his anxiety levels had dropped significantly
and that he no longer showed fear or terror to medicalrelated stimuli. In short, he no longer had the phobia,
and reported having 'never felt better'.
This demonstrates the successful treatment of bloodinjection-injury phobia using CBT and applied muscle
tension. Before treatment, the subject passed out during
phlebotomy procedures and experienced extreme anxiety
and panic when exposed to other medical procedures
and related experiences. Following treatment, and for
at least 12 months afterwards, he was able to engage in
medical procedures with minimal symptoms.
Evaluation
A case study was used that allows the participant to
be studied in great detail and can give us a detailed
understanding of the specific circumstances surrounding
them. However, a key weakness of a case study comes
from the difficulties in generalising the results. A case
study tells us only about the particular person who has
been studied and so the results cannot be generalised to
the wider population, which limits the usefulness of the
study. Furthermore, a case study cannot be replicated
as there won't be another person with the exact same
set of circumstances to allow a replication of the study,
so results cannot be checked for reliability. Why do
you think a case study was chosen by Chapman
and DeLapp?
Many different techniques were used to gather
information, including the BAI, BDI, Q-LES-Q and
BISS; all of which provide quantitative data to allow
for statistical analysis to be carried out, and for data
pre- and post-treatment to be compared. In addition,
there were detailed interviews carried out to gather
qualitative data in the nature of a full history of T's life.
A weakness, however, of all of these measures is that
they rely on self-report so this may lead to inaccurate
information. This may be due to social desirability,
subjective interpretation, or misremembering of
retrospective data; this decreases the validity of
the findings.
220)
The findings of the study by Chapman and DeLapp
can be applied to everyday life. Treatment of any phobia
is important and will of course improve the quality of
life of the patient. But finding a successful treatment
for blood phobia is particularly significant due to the
importance of attending medical procedures when
necessary. Someone with, for example, a phobia of the
sea, could, relatively easily, avoid the sea and still live a
fulfilling and otherwise healthy life. However, a blood or
related phobia could have serious repercussions on the
patient's health if they avoid medical interventions.
RESEARCH METHODS
Most research into the effectiveness of treatments
for anxiety and fear-related disorders relies
on self-report from the patient, pre- and posttreatment This is beneficial as it allows us to get
an understanding of the patient's feelings and
symptoms in what is a very subjective experience.
However, the disadvantages of self-report may
reduce the validity of the findings due to social
desirability, where the patient feels that they
should report an improvement of symptoms
even if it is not fully the case. Finally, there is the
problem of the use of self-report questionnaires or
other assessment measures, where patients may
misinterpret questions, or the use of forced choice
options may lead a patient to give an answer that
is not a true or accurate reflection of how they
really feel.
ISSUES AND DEBATES
The treatments we have explored in this section
can be applied to everyday life. As well as the
key study by Chapman and Delapp, the research
into systematic desensitisation can be applied
to everyday life as it can be used as a non-drug
treatment to help treat or reduce the severity of
phobias and therefore help patients to regain
a higher quality of life. The methods they learn
during the treatment can be used again if needed,
so this can offer a long-term solution to
their problem. "

– Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (MOCI)

Diagnostic criteria
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterised
by the presence of persistent obsessions or compulsions,
or most commonly both. Obsessions are unwanted,
repetitive thoughts (e.g. of contamination), images
(e.g. of violent scenes) or urges (e.g. to stab someone).
Obsessions are intrusive and commonly associated with
anxiety. Compulsions are repetitive behaviours (e.g.
washing or checking) or mental acts (e.g. repeating
words silently) that the individual feels driven to
perform, as a response to an obsession. The individual
feels that these must be carried out according to
rigid rules.
For a diagnosis to be made the obsessions and
compulsions must take up more than an hour per day
and must result in significant distress or significant
impairment to one or more important areas of
functioning, such as family, social or occupational.
There are many different types of obsession and
compulsion; some are shown in Table 6.7.
Example study
Rapoport's (1989) case study 'Charles'. Charles was a
14-year-old boy with OCD who spent three hours or
more each day showering, plus at least another two
6 Clinical psychology
hours getting dressed. He had elaborate and repetitive
routines for holding soap in one hand, putting it under
water, switching hands and so on. His mother contacted
Rapoport (1989) after this behaviour had been going
on for around two years. Before this, Charles had been
a good student with a particular interest in the sciences.
He had had to leave school because his washing rituals
were making it impossible for him to attend on time. He
had also been in and out of hospital for his condition,
and had already received standard treatments of
medication, behavioural therapy and psychotherapy.

Charles was, however, still utterly obsessed with the
thought that he had something sticky on his skin that
had to be washed off. In an attempt to help her son
overcome this worrying thought, his mother had helped
him clean his room and kept things he touched clean
with rubbing alcohol. He had only one friend because
his rituals left him little time to leave the house. He
underwent a drug trial for clomipramine (a type of antidepressant), which gave effective relief of his symptoms;
he was able to pour honey, for instance. Yet after a year,
he had developed a tolerance for his medication (the
effectiveness of the medication started to reduce as his
body got used to it over time). Charles relapsed and
returned to ritualistic washing and dressing.

KEYWORD

response to a particular drug may reduce, so the
medication is no longer as effective
Measures
There are several tests used to assess obsessivecompulsive disorders. We will consider two in
this section.
Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (MOCI)
The MOCI is a short assessment tool that contains
30 items that are scored either 'true' or 'false'. It assesses
symptoms relating to checking, washing, slowness and
doubting. It takes around 5 minutes to complete and
produces scores that range between O and 30. Example
items (Hodgson & Rachman, 1977, page 391) include:
• I frequently have to check things (gas or water taps,
doors, etc.) several times. (Checking)
• I am not unduly concerned about germs and
diseases. (Washing)
• I do not take a long time to dress in the morning.
(Slowness)
• Even when I do something very carefully, I often
feel that it is not quite right. (Doubting)
The MOCI was designed as a quick assessment tool
for clinicians and researchers, rather than a formal
diagnostic tool.
Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS)
The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS)
developed by Goodman et al. (1989) is a widely used
test designed to measure the nature and severity of an
individual's symptoms. The Y-BOCS involves a semistructured interview that takes around 30 minutes
to conduct. It also involves a checklist of different
obsessions and compulsions (see Table 6.8), with
a ten-item severity scale. The severity scale allows
individuals to rate the time they spend on obsessions;
how hard the obsessions are to resist and how much
distress the obsessions cause. The checklist can be used
to help plan treatment or to assess how treatment is
progressing. Scores range from O (no symptoms) to 40
(severe symptoms). Individuals with scores above 16 are
considered in the clinical range for OCD.

RESEARCH METHODS
The reliability and validity of assessment tools
such as the MOCI and Y-BOCS have been
evaluated in a number of studies. They have
good levels of concurrent validity; meaning that
individuals will score similarly on different tests
for obsessive-compulsive disorder (Esfahani et
al., 2012). They also both offer good test-retest
reliability, meaning that individuals who repeat
the measures at different times are likely to get
the same results. This is important for researchers
wanting to use the tools in trialling psychological
interventions as the measures need to be
consistent to allow for changes to be seen.
Both tests use a self-report measure, however,
which means that they rely on the individual to give
accurate and honest answers to each item. This can
be quite a subjective process for several reasons.
For example, those who are resistant to treatment
or fear being thought of badly might downplay
the severity of their symptoms. It can therefore be
difficult for researchers or clinicians to obtain a true
picture of the nature of someone's condition.
The case study (Rapoport, 1989) is useful in
helping us understand the experience of OCD in
everyday life. The experience of Charles and his
mother demonstrates the impact of compulsive
behaviours on normal functioning, such as the
extremely lengthy washing rituals that prevented
the young man from attending mainstream
schooling. It can also highlight the unique
obsessive thoughts (e.g. Charles' 'stickiness') that
are symptomatic of these disorders. 
ISSUES AND DEBATES
The use of diagnostic criteria, such as ICD-11,
as well as assessment measures such as MOC!
and Y-BOCS take a nomothetic approach. The
diagnostic criteria were designed based on data
collected from vast samples of participants and
are created to be used on the entire population.
This takes a nomothetic approach as the aim is to
create tools that apply to universally to everybody.
This is useful because it allows for the same
criteria and measures to be used by different
clinicians and therefore gives reliability to
the diagnoses. "
"• biological explanations:
– biochemical
– genetic.

• psychological explanations:
– cognitive (thinking error)
– behavioural (operant conditioning)
– psychodynamic.","Explanations
Biological
Biochemical
We have seen previously in this chapter that dopamine
is an important neurotransmitter for a range of
psychological disorders, and this is also the case for
OCD. Research shows that those with OCD tend to
have abnormally high levels of dopamine. Research
by Szechtman et al. (1998), shows that if you increase
dopamine levels in rats, they will show repetitive
movements that reflect the compulsive behaviours of
individuals with OCD.
Another neurotransmitter we have seen in the biological
explanations throughout this section is serotonin.
Research tends to show that individuals with OCD
have lower than normal levels of serotonin in their
brains. This research is supported by evidence that
shows that anti-depressants that work specifically on
increasing levels of serotonin (e.g. SSRis: see section
on Treatment and management in Section 6.3 for more
detail) are more effective treatments for OCD, than antidepressants that have less effect on serotonin (Pittenger
& Bloch, 2014).
A third biochemical explanation of OCD relates to the
influence of oxytocin. Oxytocin is commonly referred
to as the 'love hormone', because it is involved in
enhancing trust and attachment. However, oxytocin
has also been shown to increase distrust and fear of
certain stimuli, particularly those that might pose a
threat to survival. There is mixed evidence for the role
of oxytocin in the development of OCD. By analysing
cerebral spinal fluid and patient accounts of behaviour,
6 Clinical psychology
Leckman et al. (I 994) found that some forms of OCD
were related to oxytocin dysfunction. However, there is
also contrasting evidence; for example, den Boer and
Westenberg (1992) found no evidence of a link between
oxytocin and OCD. They used a double-blind, placebocontrolled study of 12 patients with OCD. Half were
given syntocinon (synthetic oxytocin) through a daily
nasal spray and half were given a placebo. No reduction
in obsessions or compulsions was reported in either
group, suggesting that there does not appear to be a link
between oxytocin and OCD.
ACTIVITY 6. 7
Go back through the biochemical explanations for
all five of the disorders we have looked at in this
chapter, and summarise which neurotransmitters
are important and how they relate to each
disorder. Dopamine and serotonin are two
neurotransmitters that we have seen several times
throughout the chapter, for example.
Genetic
Recent research suggests that OCD may have a genetic
basis. Monzani et al. (2014) carried out a large-scale
twin study and found a significantly higher concordance
rate for MZ twins (52%) compared to DZ twins (21%).
Remembering that MZ twins share 100% of their genes
and DZ twins share around 50% of their genes, these
findings suggest a genetic influence for OCD, with an
overall heritability estimated to be 48%.
Much research has been carried out to investigate which
specific genes are implicated in OCD, but no conclusive
evidence has been found. Knowing that low levels of
serotonin seem to be related to OCD, it makes sense
to consider the role of genes responsible for serotonin
levels, one of which is the SERT gene. Ozaki et al. (2003)
found a mutation of the SERT gene, leading to lower
levels of serotonin, in six members of two unrelated
families who had OCD.
Mattheisen et al. (2015) conducted a large-scale study
involving 1406 patients with OCD and other members
of the general population to analyse and identify
genes that may be linked to OCD symptoms. The
gene PTPRD was implicated, along with a gene called
SLITRK3, both of which interact to regulate particular
synapses in the brain.
We certainly don't have any definitive answers
surrounding which genes are implicated in OCD,
223) 
) CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL AS & A LEVEL PSYCHOLOGY: COURSEBOOK
and the range of different research findings shows how
complex the genetic influence is. However, what the
evidence does show is that OCD runs in families and is
more concordant in identical than non-identical twins
so there does seem to be some genetic influence.
Psychological
Cognitive (thinking error)
As you have discovered, OCD is composed of
two aspects: cognitive obsessions and behavioural
compulsions. The cognitive explanation considers
that obsessive thinking is based on faulty reasoning
(Rachman, 1977). For example, the belief that hands
are covered in harmful germs that could kill is due to
errors in thinking. These mistakes in cognition can
also worsen under stressful conditions. Compulsive
behaviours are the outcome of such erroneous thinking,
attempts to alleviate the unwanted thoughts and the
anxiety they create.
Behavioural ( operant conditioning)
Compulsive behaviour can be explained through
the principles of operant conditioning. Engaging
in behaviour such as handwashing may alleviate
the obsession over germs, albeit temporarily. The
handwashing has become a negative reinforcer because
it has relieved something unpleasant (the worrying
obsessive thoughts). It is also a positive reinforcer,
because the person is 'rewarded' by knowing that they
have clean hands (see Figure 6.22). The influence of
negative and positive reinforcement can shape obsessivecompulsive behaviours, meaning they are learned
behaviours.
Figure 6.22: A common compulsion in those suffering
with OCD is handwashing
Psychodynamic
The psychodynamic approach explains OCD
through looking at unconscious beliefs and desires.
Psychodynamic theorists claim that symptoms of OCD
appear as a result of an internal conflict between the id
and the ego. Freud suggested that such conflict arises in
the anal stage of psychosexual development, around the
time most children begin toilet training.
This process may involve tension between children and
their parents, who may wish to control how and when
the child defecates or urinates, against the child's wishes.
In an attempt to regain control the child may soil
themselves (referred to as anally expulsive), which causes
upset and arguments. Alternatively, the child may fear
harsh responses from their parents and retain faeces or
urine (referred to as anally retentive) to regain control.
According to the psychodynamic approach, both these
behaviours can lead to later behavioural disturbances,
as the individual has become 'fixated' in this stage.
Essentially, the argument is that obsessive thoughts that
come from the id disturb the rational part of the self
(the ego) to the extent that it may lead to compulsive
cleaning and tidying rituals later in life, in order to deal
with the earlier childhood trauma.
RESEARCH METHODS
The biological explanations each have strengths
and weaknesses. The scientific analysis used in
identifying genes relating to OCD is objective
and usually conducted under well-controlled
laboratory conditions. This also makes it highly
replicable. However, it does not offer a complete
picture in that it cannot explain why some
individuals may carry genes that are implicated in
OCD, yet never develop symptoms.
Biochemical explanations such as the oxytocin
hypothesis are also supported by laboratorybased studies. However, it is difficult to establish
a cause-and-effect relationship between the
hormone and OCD symptoms.
Cognitive-behavioural accounts fit well with
the experience of OCD symptoms reported by
individuals with the disorder. However, much
research in this area relies on self-report, including
measures such as the Y-BOCS or MOCI. This
introduces bias as individuals may deliberately 
or inadvertently mislead researchers. Why might
this particularly be the case for people with
disorders such as OCD?
The psychodynamic explanation, by contrast,
is not supported by empirical research. This
is because you cannot accurately measure or
control the variables involved. It means it would
be difficult to demonstrate a cause-and-effect
relationship between harsh parenting during
toilet training and a child's later compulsive
washing, for example.
ISSUES AND DEBATES
Biological and cognitive-behavioural explanations
focus on the individual and their hormonal
abnormalities or faulty thought processes
(Rachman, 1977). This ignores the role of
situational factors and can also be considered
reductionist. The psychodynamic explanation,
however, places more emphasis on early social
relationships and considers the effect these can
have on an individual's development.
Likewise, the genetic and biochemical accounts
both rely on physiological factors (genes,
hormones and neurotransmitters) which are
biological explanations. By contrast, the cognitivebehavioural and psychodynamic explanations
suggest compulsions result from learned behaviour
or from experiences in childhood, offering a
psychological, rather than biological explanation.
These explanations can all be considered to be
deterministic; we have no free will to influence our
genetic make-up, brain chemistry, early experiences
or the automatic learning processes that may lead
to developing OCD. "

• psychological therapies including:
– exposure and response prevention (ERP), including a study, e.g. Lehmkuhl et al. (2008)
– cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) (exemplified by the following key study).
","Treatment and management
Biological
SSRis
OCD can be treated with a range of different drug
therapies, including anti-depressants and anti-anxiety
medication. The most used medications to treat OCD
are SSRis. We considered the use of SSRis in treating
6 Clinical psychology
depressive disorder earlier on (section on Treatment
and management in Section 6.2). They have also been
used to treat OCD. These medications work by blocking
the serotonin from being reabsorbed once a message
has been passed from one neuron to another, meaning
that serotonin levels remain higher. In a meta-analysis,
Soomro et al. (2008) reviewed the results of 17 studies
(with a total of 3097 participants) which compared the
effectiveness of SSRis with placebos. The studies used
Y-BOCS to measure OCD symptoms. In all studies
SSRis as a group were more effective than placebos at
reducing OCD symptoms 6-13 weeks after treatment.
The effect of taking SSRis to treat OCD is that they
reduce the severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms
as they seem to lessen the anxiety associated with the
disorder. They have been shown to work in individuals
with and without depressive disorder, although generally
a higher dosage of medication is given to treat OCD
than is used to treat depressive disorder, as it has been
shown to be more effective (Pampaloni et al., 2009).
Psychological
Exposure and response prevention (ERP)
Exposure and response prevention (ERP) is a form of
CBT. Individuals are exposed to stimuli that provoke
their obsessions and the associated distress, while at the
same time they are helped to prevent their compulsive
behaviours. For example, an individual may be exposed to
a door handle, which would elicit obsessions surrounding
dirt and germs, along with a strong desire to carry out
a compulsion such as handwashing. The individual is
helped to not wash their hands but instead to tolerate the
anxiety and learn to accept their obsession and become
habituated to it (to get used to it). The key thing is to
prevent the compulsive behaviour as a response to the
obsessive thought. This helps the individual to learn that
the uncomfortable feelings will eventually go away even
without preforming a compulsive behaviour.
Example study
Lehmkuhl et al. (2008) researched the application of this
form of treatment in a case study with a 12-year-old
boy referred to as Jason who had both OCD and autism

spectrum disorder (ASD). Approximately 2% of children
with ASD are also diagnosed with OCD. It can be difficult
to distinguish ASD rituals and behaviour from compulsive
behaviour seen in OCD; however, cleaning, checking and
counting tend to be common in those with OCD. Jason
had been diagnosed with high-functioning autism (normal
IQ score), and experienced contamination fear, excessive
handwashing, counting and checking. He would spend
several hours each day engaged in compulsive behaviour
and reported significant anxiety when prevented from
completing his rituals. Jason attended ten 50-minute CBT
sessions over 16 weeks. Some of the ERP techniques
were modified to meet Jason's specific ASD needs; he
was not asked to do visualisation exercises as he would
find it impossible to imagine pretend situations. Jason
first identified feelings of distress and with the help of
the therapist, learned coping statements for when he felt
anxious (e.g. 'I know that nothing bad will happen ... ').
The next step involved exposing Jason to stimuli which he
felt were contaminated and produced feelings of anxiety
or disgust. These include common objects such as door
handles and elevator buttons. The exposure involved Jason
being asked to touch these items, and repeatedly to do so
until he became habituated, and his anxiety levels dropped.
Exposures became increasingly difficult, so that Jason was
engaging in behaviours that held increasing anxiety for him.
In between sessions, he practised this exposure through
specific tasks in his normal environment, handing out papers
in a classroom or using 'contaminated' items at home.
After completing his therapy, Jason's score on the
Y-BOCS had dropped from a severely high pre-therapy
score of 18 to just 3, well within the normal range. At a
three-month follow-up his score remained low, and both
he and his parents reported a significant improvement in
both his OCD symptoms and his participation in school
and social activities.
Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT)
We have learned about CBT as an effective treatment
throughout this chapter and the basic principles are no
different when using CBT to treat OCD. CBT works
by understanding and then challenging the irrational
thoughts held by the individual to bring out positive
change in their emotional and behavioural responses.

randomised controlled non-inferiority trial. British
medical journal, 333(7574), 883.
Context
Vast amounts of research, including from the National
Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK, have
shown that CBT can be a very effective treatment for
those suffering with OCD. CBT traditionally requires
a face-to-face session (45-60 minutes) once a week for
several weeks. Carried out in this traditional way makes
CBT an expensive treatment and also makes it very
time-consuming, which results in long waiting lists.
Not only does this mean that patients will need to wait a
long time to receive treatment, it also means that during
this waiting time there is the potential for their OCD
to become more severe, which in turn may mean that it
will be more difficult to treat and therefore take longer,
which will add to the waiting time for others. There have
been many attempts to try to ease waiting times and
make CBT more accessible. Two of these approaches
are computerised CBT and facilitated self-help, both of
which have been shown to be helpful to some extent.
Main theories and explanations
Offering CBT over the phone can be beneficial in
several ways. By offering shorter telephone sessions
this would reduce the waiting lists experienced by the
provision of the traditional face to face sessions. This
would benefit not only the patients by reducing the
length of time they need to wait for treatment, but
will also relieve the pressure on resources for whoever
provides the CBT. As well as the reduced waiting time,
telephone CBT can offer a more accessible way for
patients to be treated. Some patients may not have
their own transport, or be able to afford to pay for
public transport to attend a face to face appointment
each week. In addition, it may be more difficult to fit
in a face to face appointment around work, family or
other commitments, whereas a telephone call would
be easier to manage and would take less time. In
addition to these general difficulties faced to attend
face to face appointments it is important to consider
that people suffering from OCD are likely to find it
difficult and anxiety-provoking to travel and go to a
new environment for a face to face appointment. Mohr
et al. (2000) suggested that CBT delivered by phone has
been increasing, which offers more accessible support to
those who cannot attend a clinic. Research by Taylor
et al. (2003) has shown that, compared to face-to-face
CBT, telephone delivered CBT can be an effective, and
less expensive, treatment for individuals with OCD. 
Aims
The aim was to compare the effectiveness of CBT
carried out by telephone with CBT carried out face to
face, in the treatment of OCD. It was hypothesised that
outcomes would be similar for both methods used.
Design
A randomised controlled trial was used to compare
exposure therapy and response prevention delivered by
traditional 60-minute face-to-face sessions, or by shorter
telephone sessions (up to 30 minutes each). Ten weekly
sessions were provided for participants in each condition.
The sample consisted of 72 participants, diagnosed
with OCD, and aged between 16 and 65 years old. All
participants were from the UK and attended one of
two outpatient clinics. Participants all scored at least
16 on the Yale-Brown obsessive-compulsive checklist
(self-report version; Y-BOCS) and did not suffer from
substance misuse or other conditions such as severe
depressive disorder. Participants were randomly
assigned to either the telephone or the face-to-face
condition, making this an independent measures design.
Two experienced therapists carried out the treatments
(one at each clinic carried out both types). Consistency
of treatment was maintained by use of therapist
manuals, fortnightly supervision sessions and fourmonthly training days.
Prior to treatment, all participants were assessed twice,
four weeks apart, using the Y-BOCS to measure the
severity of their OCD and Beck Depression Inventory
(BDI), to measure feelings of depressive disorder.
Participants were then assessed, using these measures,
immediately after treatment and then at one-, three- and
six-month follow-ups. Patients were also given a client
satisfaction questionnaire. The researchers who assessed
the participants before and after treatment did not know
which condition they were in, to protect against any
potential bias from the researchers.
Results, findings and conclusions
Results (see Figure 6.23) showed that the mean Y-BOCS
score prior to treatment was 25 (indicating OCD of
marked severity). Prior to treatment there was no
significant difference between the mean scores for
Y-BOCS or the BDI between the two conditions. At
all four time points (immediately after treatment, one
month later, three months later and six months later)
clinical outcome was equivalent for each condition. Mean
scores on the Y-BOCS dropped significantly between the
6 Clinical psychology
initial scores and those following treatment. Treatment
was classed as 'clinically relevant' if the Y-BOCS mean
pre-treatment score dropped by two standard deviations
or more after treatment. This was found to be the case in
72% of the patients (77% in the telephone condition and
67% in the face-to-face treatment condition). Scores on
the client satisfaction questionnaire showed that patients
were very satisfied with their treatment and that these
results were similar across both treatment conditions.

The researchers concluded that clinical outcome of CBT
delivered by telephone was equivalent to CBT carried
out face to face at all four time points. Additionally,
participants reported similarly high levels of satisfaction
across both treatment conditions. This suggests that
patients with OCD may benefit equally from CBT
delivered over the phone, with reduced contact time,
as with traditional face-to-face CBT.
Evaluation
The research by Lovell et al. (2006) used an independent
measures experimental design in which participants were
randomly allocated to one of two conditions. Random
227 > 
) CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL AS & A LEVEL PSYCHOLOGY: COURSEBOOK
allocation to the conditions removed the possibility of
researcher bias (the researchers didn't choose who to
put in which condition) The face-to-face CBT group
acted as the control group for the experiment, meaning
researchers could compare the effectiveness of telephone
therapy to standard face-to-face CBT. The duration
of the therapy was kept the same in both conditions,
and outcomes were measured using the same validated
scales. This meant the study had high levels of validity
and reliability. However, the study used a relatively small
sample, and they are all from the UK, meaning the
extent to which the results can be generalised is limited.
Self-report measures were used, which can lead to lower
validity as the responses given may not be accurate.
Answers are subjective and individuals may not give a
true account of their symptoms: they may exaggerate
or downplay them.
Lovell et al.'s study has really important applications
to real life. Lovell et al. have evidence that shows that
a cheaper and more accessible alternative to traditional
CBT can be equally as effective as the face-to-face
approach. This has implications first to providers, such
as the NHS in the UK: if there is less contact time
required with therapists then this means over-the-phone
CBT is a more cost-effective approach, which means
funds will stretch further. Over-the-phone CBT also
benefits the patients because it increases the accessibility.
As the individual doesn't need to attend a clinic, it will
be, at the very least, easier for them, but could also
potentially overcome huge obstacles as some individuals
with OCD may struggle to leave their home. Another
benefit to patients is that over-the-phone CBT will lead
to shorter waiting lists so patients can get the help they
need sooner.
The study by Lovell et al. (2006) raises the debate
of biological versus psychological treatments. As
we have discovered throughout this chapter, both
biological treatments, such as antipsychotics and
anti-depressants, and psychological treatments, such
as CBT and systematic desensitisation have strengths
and weaknesses. Lovell et al. (2006) investigate the
effectiveness of CBT face to face compared to via the
phone, however this purely focuses on psychological
treatments. Psychological treatments may be
considered to be superior to biological treatments in
that they help the patient deal with the source of the
problem; allow them to learn techniques that they
can use again if necessary; and allow the patient to
take responsibility for their treatment. In comparison,
biological treatments are generally quicker, easier,
and cheaper, which can make them a more appealing
228)
option. Lovell et al.'s research into a method of
administering CBT that is quicker and therefore
cheaper than other ways of administering CBT,
is a great way to mitigate these factors.
ACTIVITY 6.8
Rav has been diagnosed with OCD. He has been
given lots of information about the different
treatment options available to him but he is
feeling quite overwhelmed as there is so much
to consider and there seem to be strengths and
weaknesses of all the options. Make a table to
briefly summarise some of the treatment options
that Rav may be considering. Include strengths
and weaknesses of each, but make it as simple for
him as possible to try to reduce his confusion.
RESEARCH METHODS
Lehmkuhl et al. (2008) used a case study
to investigate the effectiveness of ERP as a
treatment for OCD. This method offers limited
generalisability, particularly so in this case because
the participant also had ASD, meaning he was
not representative of the general population of
OCD sufferers. Jason was only 12 years old and
had additional needs; both these factors raise
ethical issues around briefing, consent and the risk
of psychological harm. However, it does give us
an in-depth understanding of the experience of
going through ERP and captures both quantitative
and qualitative data through interview and
Y-BOCS scores.
ISSUES AND DEBATES
Cognitive-behavioural therapies and SSRls are
the most frequently used treatments for OCD,
meaning research in this area is applicable to
real life. The more we can understand about
the effectiveness of treatments for different
disorders, the more likely a patient is to be given
a treatment that works for them. Research, such
as that by Lehmkuhl et al. (2008) that investigates
suitability of treatments for different individuals
makes a really important contribution to
application to real life. 
CONTINUED
In terms of individual vs situational explanations,
the use of SSRls to manage OCD treats only one
aspect: the individual's serotonin uptake. This
treatment does not alter their environment or take
into consideration what might have caused the
OCD symptoms to emerge in the first place. In
this way SSRls can be seen as limited and, instead,
ideally, treatment would consider both individual
and situational factors. "

including a study, e.g. Vrechopoulos et al. (2004).
","7 .1 The physical
environment
The physical environment of a shop or restaurant is an
important influence on the atmosphere of the place,
and will be a big part of what makes a consumer enjoy
their experience. The physical environment refers to the
interior and exterior design of the setting, as well as
other factors that influence the ambience, such as sound
and scent.
Retail store design
Types of store exterior design
Before even entering a shop, there are exterior design
features which influence the views and feelings of
the shopper. Exterior features including storefront,
window displays and landscaping are all important in
making a positive impression on potential customers.
These features are particularly important for small,
independent shops that cannot rely on their big brands
to draw in customers.
Most research into the influence of store exteriors uses
the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) model (Babin
et al., 2003), which assumes that the stimuli, such as
physical environment, affects consumer's attitude, which
further affects behaviour (see the section The effect of
ambience: the pleasure-arousal-dominance (PAD) model
for more detail).
In terms of landscaping, evidence tends to show that
the presence of vegetation positively influences the
moods of respondents who live in an urban setting
(Sheets & Manzer, 1991) so it is logical that a shop with
landscaping outside would give a positive impression.
Chebat and Morrin (2007) used plants and flowers to
decorate malls and found this to have positive effects on
shoppers' perception of the environment and on their
perception of the quality of the products.
In terms of window displays, this is the best chance a
shop has of showing potential customers what they
can expect in the store. Edwards and Shackley (1992)
found that sales were higher for stores that used window
displays compared to stores that did not, and that a
larger window display is more effective than a smaller
one. A successful window display was aesthetically
pleasing, used lighting effectively, had a theme and used
warm colours.

KEYWORD
stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R model):
a model that can be applied to explain
consumer behaviours. Stimuli, such as physical
environment, affects consumer's attitude, which
further affects behaviour
Example study
Mower et al. (2012) investigated the effects of both window
display and landscaping on consumer responses in terms
of liking, mood and patronage intentions (whether they
intended to go into the shop, buy anything from the shop,
recommend the shop and revisit the shop). An online
survey was conducted with a sample of 180 students
(mostly female) from an American university. Participants
were asked to imagine they need to buy a new pair of jeans,
then they logged onto a website and read a description of
a store exterior of a small clothes shop. All descriptions
included detail of the building, but they varied as to
whether they included descriptions of window displays,
or not, and descriptions of landscaping, or not, to test the
effects of these variables. Results showed that the presence
of a window display and landscaping both positively
influenced liking of the store exterior as well as intention to
shop there. Furthermore, liking of store exteriors increased
pleasure and arousal experienced, which in tum led to
increased patronage intentions (see Figure 7.1)
Figure 7 .1: An attractive store exterior influences
consumer satisfaction 
Types of store interior design
The interior design of the store is also significant in
influencing consumer behaviour. There are three main
layouts that can be used in stores (see Figure 7.2):
• Grid: the grid is the layout that is used in most
supermarkets and other convenience stores. Products
are displayed in long aisles, and customers weave up
and down the aisles. Impulse items (such as treats) tend
to be at the front and essential items (such as milk or
rice) tend to be at the back. This is so that customers
need to walk past other items such as impulse items
on the way to get the essentials they need, which
encourages them to spend more. The grid allows all
similar items to be grouped together, and to keep
different items apart; making it easier to shop where
there are a range of different types of item, such as a
supermarket. The grid is beneficial because it is easy
and familiar to customers, allows for predictable traffic
flow to help decide where to put promotions, and it
is easy to construct shelving, etc. in this layout. The
downsides to a grid layout may include confusion for
customers if they don't understand the grouping of
items, frustration if it is not possible for customers
to go directly to the item they need, and the lack of
creativity or interest of the layout.
• Freeform: as the name suggests, the freeform layout
does not follow any specific rules or criteria, and
customers are not deliberately forced to go in any
direction. Customers are encouraged to wander
and browse the items in the shop, often leading to
impulse buys. It is best suited to shops with less
merchandise but perhaps of higher value, such as
boutiques or gift shops. If done well, a freeform
layout can be a really positive experience for the
customer, but it can be difficult to get right and can
be cluttered or be confusing to the customer.
• Racetrack: the racetrack is designed so that the route
taken by customers takes the form of a loop from the
starting point, all the way around the store and past all
the merchandise through to the check outs and the exit.
This is used famously by IKEA, and other department
stores. The main positive of a racetrack layout is
that it leads to maximum exposure of merchandise to
customers, encouraging more purchases. It also allows
for a predictable traffic pattern, making it easy to place
promotions and high-end products where they will be
most visible. The downsides of a racetrack, however, is
that customers are not able to browse as they wish, and
they may find it frustrating and time-consuming if they
are intending to buy specific items.

of store interior design

) CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL AS & A LEVEL PSYCHOLOGY: COURSEBOOK
ACTIVITY 7 .1
Work in pairs to design a high-end gift shop.
Describe each feature of your shop and the
justification for it. Remember to consider the
sort of shop you are designing and who you are
expecting your customers to be. Include features
that relate to the exterior and interior of your
shop.
Example study
Vrechopoulos et al. (2004) manipulated the layout of
a virtual grocery store to reflect the three main layouts
used in physical supermarkets: grid, freeform and
racetrack. They proposed four hypotheses, based on
the assumption that research findings based in physical
shopping will also apply to virtual shopping:
• Hypothesis I Consumers will perceive the grid
layout to be most useful for planned purchases.
• Hypothesis 2 Consumers will perceive the freeform
layout to be easier to use in general.
• Hypothesis 3 The racetrack layout will be more
entertaining than the other two layouts.
• Hypothesis 4 Consumers will spend more time
shopping in the freeform layout.
To make the transition from real-life layouts to webbased shopping experiences there were several steps
taken. The three layout patterns were analysed and
the key features of each were transferred to a webbased virtual store layout. Other characteristics such
as background colour, product images, speed and so
on were kept the same across the three layouts. As a
result of the analysis and transformation, the three store
layouts were represented online as described:
• Grid: this involved a hierarchical structure
(e.g., select product category, then select product
subcategory, then select final product).
• Freeform: this involved being able to reach the
desired products immediately, through either a
search button or by selecting an item displayed
on the page.
• Racetrack: customers are forced to navigate
through specific paths to reach their desired
240)
products. Each page has a choice of two 'corridors'
and customers must select one of these to continue
in their search for their product.
One hundred and twenty participants were recruited
from both Greece and the UK to take part in a
laboratory experiment where they were given a planned
shopping task with money to spend and completed
this task in one of the three virtual store layouts.
Each participant was given a budget of £20
(or 12 000 Greek drachmas) and whatever was
'purchased' during the experiment was subsequently
purchased by the researchers and physically delivered to
the participants.
The online store offered mainly European brands
(e.g. Coca-Cola and Pringles) but also included some
own-brand products. To make the online experience
as similar to a real-life shopping trip as possible,
participants were given a blank shopping list and
information about what was available in the store in
order to plan their purchases.
The results showed that the freeform layout was
significantly more useful for finding items on a shopping
list. It was also reported to be the most entertaining
to use. The grid layout was reported to be significantly
easier to use than the other two layouts (with the
racetrack layout the hardest to use). Finally, the layout
significantly affected the length of time that customers
spent shopping, with the racetrack and freeform layouts
engaging shoppers for longer, as would be predicted by
conventional retail theory.
None of the researchers' hypotheses were found to be
supported. Since the hypotheses were based on research
into real-life shopping experiences, this suggest that
such theories cannot be readily applicable to online
grocery retail and that customers visiting a virtual
grocery store prefer a hierarchical/tree structure. Such
a structure is only provided by a grid layout which was
perceived as the easiest to use. Shopping behaviour was
also facilitated by being able to reach any place in the
store directly (that is from the home page or from any
other 'place' in the store). This was only provided by the
freeform layout which was perceived as the most useful
for conducting planned purchases. 
RESEARCH METHODS
Much research into the effect of store exterior
design, such as Mower et al. (2012), has been
carried out using self-report methods, such
as surveys and questionnaires. These are a
useful tool to use as they allow researchers
to understand the thoughts and feelings of a
consumer, rather than just viewing their behaviour.
However, the main problems with these methods
are that participants may not give an accurate
or true account of their thoughts and feelings,
or they may misunderstand the questions, thus
reducing the validity. Furthermore, as Mower et al.
asked participants hypothetical questions about
the influence of store exterior on their purchase
intentions, their research doesn't tell us about the
influence on consumers' actual behaviour, so it
lacks ecological validity. How could the ecological
validity be increased? Vrechopoulos et al. (2004)
used a laboratory experiment, with a virtual store,
and, although this too lacked ecological validity, it
had high control of variables, which increased the
validity, and used a standardised procedure, which
increased the reliability.
ISSUES AND DEBATES
Application of psychology to everyday life is
relevant in research into retail store design because
all the research is aimed at trying to understand
consumer perceptions and feelings and the impact
that these have on consumers' purchases. The
findings of this research can be used to inform
and advise owners of shops to allow them a better
understanding of how to attract customers and
therefore increase their profit. "

7 Consumer psychology
Context
Research has shown that many factors, such as lighting,
decoration and smell, can influence the atmosphere of
retail environments. More specifically, research has shown
the effect of different genres of background music in
restaurants on customers' spending. Creating a certain
atmosphere with the right genre of music can encourage
people to spend more money, when compared to there
being no music at all, as well as compared to other genres.
North and Hargreaves (1998) investigated the effect
of music genres on perception of a student cafeteria
and intention to spend money. Classical music led to a
perception of the cafeteria as being more upmarket and
led to customers claiming they would spend more money,
when compared to no music playing, or to other genres.
Participants listening to classical music claimed they
would spend 20.5% more than if no music was playing,
18.8% higher than easy listening music, and 3.7% higher
than pop music. However, this research looked only at
intentions to purchase, not actual spending.
Main theories and explanations
There are different explanations as to why music genres
affect customers' spending. It can be as simple as the
fact that if you are in a shop or a restaurant where there
is music playing that you like, you will be more likely to
stay for longer, and as a consequence, spend more. Other
explanations suggest that the genre of music being
played should encourage a particular mood in order
to encourage spending. This may be a case of music to
excite and arouse the customer, perhaps to encourage
impulsive purchases, or it may be to relax the customer
so they spend their money more freely. Research such as
North and Hargreaves (above) suggests that customers
in a retail environment, such as a restaurant, associate
classical music with more affluence and wealth and so
it primes them to spend more money.
KEYWORD
primed: you are 'ready' or 'prepared' to act in
a certain way in a particular scenario
Aims
The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of
musical style on the amount of money customers spent
in a restaurant. It was predicted that classical music
would lead to customers spending more money than
pop music. The researchers were unsure of the effect
of no music relative to classical music or pop music.
241 ) 
) CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL AS & A LEVEL PSYCHOLOGY: COURSEBOOK
Design
The study was a field experiment, carried out at a
restaurant. For one week there was classical music being
played, for one week there was pop music being played
and for one week there was no background music. The
volume of the music remained consistent, and two
76-minute CDs were made for each condition, each
featuring well-known classical or pop music. Aside from
the change in music, all other aspects of the restaurant
remained the same, including lighting, temperature and
menu. The time spent between being seated and paying
the bill was recorded, as this would affect the amount
of money spent. Customer bills were collected and
analysed, and an experimenter collected these data while
working as a waitress in the restaurant.
The sample was made up of 393 customers who ate at the
restaurant between February and March 2002. There was
an approximately equal number of males and females,
and approximately the same number of participants
in each condition. Opportunity sampling was used:
participants were customers who ate at the restaurant
during the time of the research. The study used an
independent measures design; where each participant was
exposed to only one of the music conditions.
The independent variable was the background music played
at the restaurant: pop music, classical music or no music.
The dependent variables were spending on starters, main
courses, desserts, coffees, bar drinks, wine, total spend on
food, total spend on drinks and total overall spend.
Results, findings and conclusions
Results showed that for starters, coffee, total food and
total overall spend, there was a significant difference in
spending between conditions; for each of these categories,
spending was highest in the classical music condition.
The researchers concluded that classical music led
to significantly higher spending in restaurants, when
compared to pop music or to no music. The results are
in line with expectations, based on previous research.
Evaluation
North et al. used a field experiment, which has high
ecological validity as it was carried out in a real-life
setting so we can apply the results beyond the research
setting. The experiment was also highly controlled as the
researchers ensured all other aspects of the restaurant
stayed the same throughout, and the music was played
at the same volume, using the same set up of two CDs
for each condition. This high level of control increases
242 )
the validity of the study as we can be more confident
that the change in money spent was due to the change in
music genre, rather than anything else. There was a large
sample of almost 400 participants, allowing for large
amounts of data to be collected, again increasing the
validity of the study. Application to real life is relevant
for North et al.'s research because it is investigating the
way in which music affects how much money customers
would spend in a restaurant. This was carried out over
a series of nights at a real restaurant and the results
clearly showed that customers spend more money
when they are listening to classical music. This has
implications for real life because restaurant owners and
managers can use this information to make changes to
their restaurant to help to increase their profit.
The effect of background noise on the
perception of food taste
There is much evidence to show that background sounds
associated with food can influence our experience of
eating, in terms of taste and other properties, such as
'crispiness'. Zampini and Spence (2004) found that
manipulating the sound made by biting a crisp (potato
chip) (by recording it, making it louder and playing that
sound through headphones) affected ratings of crispness
and freshness. Broadly speaking, the evidence tends to
show that sounds that are connected to the food (e.g. the
sound of biting a crisp) influence experience of eating
and tasting the food.
Example study
Woods et al. (2011) investigated whether sounds not
directly associated with eating could still influence a
person's perception of food. Forty-eight participants took
part in Study 1, and each participant completed 25 trials,
in each of three conditions. Participants sat at a table
with their eyes closed and wearing headphones and were
given bite-sized pieces of different foods to eat. There
were three conditions: loud white noise, quiet white noise
and no white noise, and the order of these conditions was
counterbalanced. For each condition there were soft and
hard foods in both salty and sweet tastes (salty; cheese and
crisps; sweet; flapjack and biscuit) (see Figure 7.3). After
eating each piece of food, participants were asked to rate
the food for intensity of sweetness, saltiness and liking.
Results for Study 1 showed that sweetness and saltiness
were both rated lower in the loud condition than in the
quiet condition. Soft and hard foods were not affected
differently, so it is concluded that background noises
affect both soft and hard foods equally. Food liking 
appeared to be lowered by loud background noise, but
this was not shown to be statistically significant. The
researchers concluded that taste was reported to be less
intense when in the noisy condition. Importantly, this
was the case for both crunchy and soft food, so it does
not appear to be linked to sounds associated with food
or eating (see Zampini & Spence, 2004).
Figure 7 .3: Does background noise affect taste
perception?
Why does sound influence taste?
We will explore four different explanations for the effect
of sound on taste.
A direct interaction between sensory cortices: each of
our senses are processed in specific parts of our cerebral
cortex and are generally processed independently of
each other. However, some evidence (Teichert & Bolz,
2018) suggests that these sensory cortices can interact,
for example, the area responsible for processing taste
may interact directly with the area responsible for
sound. Wesson and Wilson (2010) found that playing
a continuous tone activated 19% of neurons in the
olfactory tubercle of rats (usually associated with
processing odour/taste). Furthermore, the response of
29% of these neurons to odour was changed when the
tone was played, thus showing a direct effect of sound
on odour. This could explain why sound can influence
our experience of taste; the two senses are not processed
completely independently of each other.

KEYWORDS
sensory cortices: the different parts of the cortex

from each of the senses
cerebral cortex: the outermost layer of the
brain, responsible for different functions, such
as thought, perception, and memory
olfactory tubercle: a processing centre in the
olfactory cortex, with many functions including
processing of odour and taste
contrast effect: a cognitive bias where our
perception is altered because we compare two
things to each other, rather than assessing each
individually
• A cross-modal contrast: a contrast effect is a
cognitive bias where our perception of something is
distorted when we compare it to something else. By
enhancing the differences between the two things,
our perception is distorted. For example, a drink
tastes sweeter when drunk straight after something
that is less sweet, compared to when you drink it
after something sweeter. In terms of the effect of
noise on taste, this explanation proposes that this
contrast effect can occur across the senses. So, this
would explain why, for example, hearing a loud
noise might impair your ability to perceive a taste
as intensely as you would without the loud noise.
• Attentional: this explanation suggests that the
presence of a loud noise takes attention away
from the taste experience, and this is responsible
for the influence of noise on taste. Research by
Boyle et al. (2006) shows that ratings of pain were
lower when people experience loud background
noise, compared to no noise. This suggests that the
background noise distracts attention and therefore
reduces the perception of pain. The same could be
applied to the effect of noise on taste: a loud noise
distracts attention and therefore reduces the ability
to fully perceive taste.
• Implicit association: this explanation is based on the
suggestion that certain types of noise are associated
with certain tastes, although the cause for this is not
yet known. Crisinel and Spence (2010) found that
the names of bitter foods (such as coffee) and salty
foods (such as crisps and salt) were associated with
low pitch sounds. Sweet foods (such as sugar and
243) 
) CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL AS & A LEVEL PSYCHOLOGY: COURSEBOOK
honey) and sour foods (such as lime and lemon)
were associated with high-pitch sounds. Therefore,
it could be that different types of background noise
could affect tastes differently, depending on their
association.
RESEARCH METHODS
The study by Woods et al. used repeated
measures design, where each participant
completed 25 trials in all three conditions.
The results could then be compared for each
participant in each condition, thus removing the
effect of participant variables and increasing
the validity of the study. Furthermore, the study
used counterbalancing, where the order of the
conditions was different for different participants,
to remove order effects. What would change if the
researchers used an independent groups design
instead?
ISSUES AND DEBATES
Individual versus situational explanations is
relevant to the research in this section. For
example, Woods et al. investigated the effects of
background noise on taste, so they were studying
situational explanations for our experiences. The
results showed that sound did indeed influence
our experience of taste and there were several
explanations proposed to explain this, all of which
focus on situational explanations. This suggests
that our taste experience can be explained at least
partially as a result of situational factors. However,
individual factors might also be important, but
these were not explored in this research. "

The effect of ambience: the pleasurearousal-dominance (PAD) model
The pleasure-arousal-dominance model (PAD model)
was developed by Mehrabian and Russell (1974) to
demonstrate the way physical environments influence
people through their emotional impact. Mehrabian
and Russell proposed three dimensions of individuals'
emotions that influence their response to an environment:
pleasure, arousal and dominance. Pleasure relates to
the extent to which the consumer feels happy, content
or satisfied. Arousal relates to the extent to which the
consumer feels stimulated or excited. Dominance refers
to the person's feeling of being in control.
Donovan and Rossiter (1982, cited in Mehrabian &
Russell, 1974) applied this model to retail environments
and concluded that dominance wasn't significantly
relevant. They found, however, that pleasure and arousal
interact. If the ambience (atmosphere) of a shop leads to
an interaction of feelings of happiness and satisfaction
(pleasure) and excitement and stimulation (arousal) the
consumer is more likely to show 'approach' behaviours.
These 'approach' behaviours include the desire to enter
and explore the shop, to interact with staff and other
customers and to be satisfied with the environment.
However, if the ambience leads to feelings of
dissatisfaction and boredom, the consumer is more likely
to show 'avoidance' behaviour and choose not to spend
time and money in the shop. Approach behaviours of
course make a consumer more likely to make purchases
and become loyal customers who return in the future.
KEYWORDS

how physical environments influence people

The effects of odour on shopper
pleasure-arousal-dominance
The background scent of an environment has become
more and more important in recent years; with
most retail environments using some sort of scent to
encourage customers in and to increase their sense of
satisfaction with their shopping experience. The scent
can range from simple air fresheners to advanced aroma
technology, and some companies (such as bakeries and
cafes) have released synthetic scents (artificial scents
of, e.g., baking and fresh coffee) to attract customers
(Hunter, 1995). 
Example study
Chebat and Michon (2003) investigated the influence of
ambient odours on mall shoppers and compared the
PAD model to a cognitive theory of emotions (Lazarus,
1991). A shopping mall in Canada was used in this
study; in the control week nothing was changed (there
was no ambient odour), and in the following week a
light, pleasing scent was diffused into the mall's main
corridor. A citrus scent was used as previous research
has suggested that citrus is an effectively pleasing scent
(Spangenberg et al., 1996). A sample of shoppers in each
week were asked to complete a questionnaire about their
shopping trip but were not told the purpose of the study.
As we have discussed, the PAD model suggests that
ambient odour would influence consumers' mood,
and therefore their approach/avoidance behaviours
through the interaction between pleasure and arousal.
In contrast, Lazarus' cognitive theory proposes that the
ambient odour is perceived by consumers, but that this
doesn't lead to a change in mood.
Chebat and Michon's study found that, although
ambient scent increased arousal in consumers, it did not
increase feelings of pleasure. It was found that pleasure
and arousal do not mediate the effects of environmental
cues on perceptions and behaviours. The findings did,
however, support the cognitive model: that a light and
pleasant ambient odour directly influenced consumers'
perception of the shopping environment and product
quality. Overall, this study has shown that a light and
pleasant background odour does have a positive effect
on consumers' perception of the shopping environment.
However, it does not support the PAD model, it instead
suggests that odour has a direct effect on perception
without an influence on mood.
The effects of crowding on shopper
pleasure-arousal-dominance
Crowding is just one of many physical aspects of a
shopping environment that has been shown to affect
the experience of the consumer. Perceived crowding
occurs when a person's demand for space is exceeded
by the supply (Stokols, 1972). Crowding will be
affected by anything that restricts the amount of space
a person requires or desires. Spatial crowding relates
to the number of physical objects, whereas human
crowding relates to the amount of people in a space (see
Figure 7.4). Research by Eroglu and Machleit (1990)
shows that perceived crowding can influence decisions
about where to shop, as well as satisfaction with
shopping experience.

Example study
Machleit et al. (2000) investigated how perceived crowding
influenced the shoppers' satisfaction, and whether this
relationship was moderated by emotions. A set of three
studies were carried out. There were two field experiments,
where samples of students and non-students were asked to
complete a questionnaire about their shopping experience
across a range of retail environments. There was one
laboratory experiment, where students were asked to
imagine they were going to a bookstore and then shown a
video clip of the store, with spatial and human crowding
density manipulated. Following this, they were asked to
complete a questionnaire about their thoughts, feelings and
perceptions of the bookstore.
The results of all three studies show that the effect of
crowding on shopping satisfaction is complex. Perceived
crowding, both in terms of spatial and human crowding,
lowers satisfaction, and this effect is greater for spatial
crowding.
In terms of the PAD model, the results of the two field
studies show that emotions can partially mediate the
effect of crowding on satisfaction. When pleasure and

) CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL AS & A LEVEL PSYCHOLOGY: COURSEBOOK
arousal are included as mediating factors, the crowdingsatisfaction relationship (for both spatial and human
crowding) drops but is still significant. This means that
pleasure and arousal do appear to have some mediating
effect on the influence of crowding on satisfaction but
that there are other important factors as well, such as
expectation and tolerance.
KEYWORD

RESEARCH METHODS
Machleit et al.'s use of two field experiments
and one laboratory experiment is a good way of
investigating perceived crowding as it enabled
them to benefit from the strengths of both types
of experiments. There is usually a trade-off
between lab and field experiments in terms of
ecological validity and control. A field experiment
has high ecological validity and tells us about
how people behave in a real-life setting, which
is particularly important when investigating
something such as consumer behaviour as it
means we can generalise the findings more
confidently beyond the research setting. However,
the downside is that field experiments lack the
high level of control achieved by laboratory
experiments. By using both types of experiments,
Machleit et al. have been able to get the best of
both worlds, while understanding the weaknesses
of each experiment type.
ISSUES AND DEBATES
Cultural differences are relevant in this section
because it considers retail atmospherics. The
research focuses on the influence of odour in
a shopping mall and crowding across a range
of different shops in Canada and the USA. It is
important to consider the fact that these are two
large Western developed cultures where large
shopping malls and a wide range of different shops
are the norms, and where shopping is considered a
leisure activity, as well as part of daily life.
246)
CONTINUED
In some cultures, however, shopping malls would
not exist and any shops that were present would
be smaller and based on need rather than leisure.
Therefore, the findings of this research would not
be applicable to all cultures. "

Environmental influences on

Wayfinding in shopping malls
Wayfinding refers to our ability to know where we are
and to plan a route to where we are going. Certain tools
can help us with wayfinding, for example to find our way
around a shopping mall, we may rely on maps and signs.
KEYWORD
wayfinding: refers to our ability to know where
we are and to plan a route to where we are
going. Certain tools can help us with wayfinding,
for example to find our way around a shopping
mall, we may rely on maps and signs 
Weisman (1981) identified four groups of environmental
variables that can help with wayfinding: visual cues or
landmarks within or outside of a building; architectural
differences between different parts of a building; the use
of signs and room numbers; building configuration. A
trip to a shopping mall is likely to involve visiting several
different shops and so the ease of which a consumer can
find their way around will have a direct impact on the
satisfaction they experience (Arthur & Passini, 1992).
KEYWORD
building configuration: the overall size and shape
of a building, and the way the building is laid out
Example study
Dogu and Erkip (2000) aimed to investigate how spatial
factors, such as signs and maps, could aid wayfinding
within a shopping mall. The case study was carried out
in a shopping mall in Ankara, Turkey, where the spatial
layout was analysed, and questionnaires were given
to shoppers. The shopping mall was categorised and
evaluated in terms of architecture, graphics and verbal
information. In terms of architecture, there is a central
atrium at the main entrance, with many shops leading off
the main corridor (see Figure 7.5). The layout is almost
symmetrical and there are three other entrances, and three
floors. There are circular corridors on each level, which
indicate the direction of travel. Elevators and escalators
connect the three floors. Graphic information all follows
the same consistent style and is almost all based on
pictographs rather than text (aside from 'WC' and 'Exit').
Door numbers are confusing; all shops on the ground
floor are numbered in the '1 00's but not all shops on the
second floor are in the 200s, nor are all shops on the third
floor in the 300s. Also, numbers are not all in order as
some shops were split later, so numbers have been added
later are out of order. This of course makes wayfinding
more difficult. The 'You Are Here' map and directory are
just across from the main entrance, but they sit parallel to
the direction of approach so are not very easy to see. The

directory is confusing and illogical, perhaps because it is
organised in a bureaucratic hierarchy (those who pay the
most money or are most important get the best spaces)
rather than in a way that logically helps with wayfinding.
In terms of verbal information, the information desk sits
prominently in the main atrium and security guards are
helpful when approached.
Questionnaires asked about participants' views of the
shopping mall in terms of wayfinding, focusing on all the
areas described previously. Results showed that, although
signage was not seen as more important than building
configuration for wayfinding, there was a significant
relationship between the evaluation of the shopping mall
for wayfinding and its signage system. Those who found
wayfinding easy found the signage to be significant, but
many didn't notice the signs and others found them
insufficient. Most respondents found 'You Are Here' maps
to be useful, but 47% didn't believe there were any in this
mall ( demonstrating that they are not placed in a very
visible or accessible way). There was a slight relationship
between door numbers and wayfinding, but none of the
architectural characteristics were significant for wayfinding.
The researchers concluded that the most important feature
that helped with wayfinding was signage. Other features,
such as building configuration, visual access and use of
circular paths, appeared to influence individuals differently,
so would benefit from further research.

Spatial movement patterns
Shopper behaviour has been researched in different
contexts, and research has shown that the purpose of
the trip and the shopper profile can influence movement
and behaviour patterns. There are different types of
shopping trip that have been identified based on whether
the trip is a big weekly shop, or just popping in for
certain things. There are also different types of shopper
identified: some who have a list and are focused on what
they need, and others who wander up and down aisles
and see what they fancy. The types of trip and the type
of shopper will affect the sort of movement pattern that
is used.
Example study
Gil et al. (2009) examined patterns of shopper
movement and behaviour in a supermarket. They
tracked movements of over 480 shoppers, and
interviewed them after their visit, to produce shopper
profiles. The study is non-experimental because the
researchers did not manipulate any variables. The
researchers were interested in whether store layout has
an impact on shopper behaviours, specifically movement
patterns, shopping duration and interaction with
products. They aimed to identify distinctive movement
patterns and to see if these patterns can be associated
with certain shopper groups.
Shoppers were initially approached to take part in a
survey, and basic information (such as age, gender and
size of group) was recorded. CCTV (video surveillance
often used in shops for security) was used to track
their journey around the shop, using a coloured tag to
248)
identify them. As they left the store, they were given a
more detailed interview. The interview covered a range
of topics, asking the shopper about the purpose of their
trip, their use of a shopping list, satisfaction with their
shopping and the amount of money spent. Participants
were also asked about more general shopping habits
such as the frequency of shopping trips. The CCTV
recordings were processed to extract data on the store
areas visited, the time spent in each area and the type of
product interactions. The researchers concluded that, as
expected, shopper behaviour is strongly affected by the
location of products within the store. Also as expected,
some areas are more popular than others, with milk,
fruit and vegetables, and bread being the busiest and
non-food and baby products being the least busy.
A more interesting result is that it is possible to identify
four distinct patterns of movement around the store:
•
•
•
•
Short trip: a short, simple trip for a few targeted
items, and not necessarily visiting the most popular
products (32 shoppers).
Round trip: moving up and along the top corridor,
then returning along the main corridor with
detours into various aisles (173 shoppers).
Central trip: using the main corridor for entering
and exiting the building, and moving down various
aisles, mostly the top aisles initially then the bottom
aisles on the return (110 shoppers).
Wave trip: linear progression along the main
corridor, zigzagging through the aisles and mostly
exiting near the far end of the store (166 shoppers).
Figure 7.6 shows these four patterns of movement.

There were no significant differences in the types of
people making each type of trip. It instead appears to
represent individual preference.
Of further interest was the identification of five types of
spatial behaviour patterns:
• The Specialist
• focusing on a few products and spending a
lot of time with each product, though not
necessarily resulting in a purchase.
• These shoppers are mainly on 'top-up' or 'nonfood' mission.
• 19 shoppers, 25% males, 58% use baskets, 85%
shop for less than 20 minutes.

) CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL AS & A LEVEL PSYCHOLOGY: COURSEBOOK
• The Explorer
• _ The longest trip, visiting all aisles in the store
and often visiting places more than once.
• This involves spending a long time with
products and buying a lot and involve a 'main'
shopping mission.
• 67 shoppers, 62% females shopping alone, 87%
take a trolley, 43% have a shopping list (highest
of all categories).
• The Raider
• Involving fast movements and fast decisions,
showing preference for the main corridor but
going where necessary.
• These have the highest proportion of male
shoppers and are on 'top-up' or 'food for
tonight' missions.
• 113 shoppers, 33% male (biggest proportion
of all categories), 100% walking at medium
or fast speed.
Gil et al. concluded that this information about
shopper behaviour could be further investigated
in other stores with other layouts.
RESEARCH METHODS
Dogu and Erkip (2000) used a case study to
find out about factors that affect wayfinding in
a shopping mall. The use of a case study means
that the researchers could gather lots of detailed
information about the shopping mall and this can
give a really good insight into a range of factors.
However, the problems with using a case study
is that it is just focusing on this one shopping
mall, so the results cannot be fully generalised
to other shopping malls, as they are all unique.
Case studies can be criticised for lacking reliability
because they cannot be replicated due to the
unique nature, so there is no way to test if their
results would be found again.
Gil et al. (2009) used a different approach in their
work: by using a non-experimental design where
no variables were manipulated. This means that
they are just gathering data from people's normal
everyday lives. The use of CCTV allowed for
consumers to be tracked, and they also

used interviews to find out about consumers'
experience. The interviews provided information
about the shoppers' intentions and experiences
of the shop that, combined with the CCTV
tracking, allowed the researchers to get a good
understanding of different shopper behaviour.
ISSUES AND DEBATES
The studies carried out by Gil et al. and by Dogu
and Erkip both take a holistic approach in their
research. They both use a range of different
approaches in their investigation in order to
try to gather as full and holistic understanding
as possible. Gil et al., for example, used CCTV
tracking to measure observable behaviour of the
customers in the shop, but then they also used
interviews to understand the customers' attitudes,
thoughts and feelings, making the approach
holistic. Similarly, Dogu and Erkip carried out
a case study on a shopping mall so they could
look in detail at all aspects of the spatial layout,
as well as giving questionnaires to customers
to get an understanding of their attitudes and
feelings about the mall. How could individual
versus situational explanations be applied to
environmental influences on consumer behaviour?"

Eye-movement patterns, framing and
common menu mistakes
The menu is the most important marketing tool for a
restaurant, so it is vital for owners and managers to
understand how it can be used to increase sales and
improve customer loyalty (see Figure 7.7). There are
many common mistakes that can be made with menus,
as well as many clever tips to encourage sales of key
items. Key items may be those with the biggest profit
margins, signature dishes, or those that are quick and
easy to prepare. These mistakes and tips are discussed
in the paper by Pavesic (2005). 
Figure 7 .7: The menu is an important marketing tool
for a restaurant
Example study
Pavesic (2005) reported that the average time spent reading
a menu is 109 seconds. This is an important piece of
information for someone designing a menu. The use of
eye tracking can inform us of the typical way in which
customers will look at a menu, and this can be used to
determine where to place certain items. See Figure 7 .8
for eye tracking in Pavesic's study. The pattern of eye
movement is not fixed, however, and can be amended and
directed by 'eye magnets'. 'Eye magnets' are anything
that draws someone's attention to particular menu items.
This may be a box around the item, a different coloured
background, a larger or bolder font, or a photo or
illustration. These all work by directing the eye movement
to the item you would like to encourage your customers
to buy. 'Framing' is a method of drawing the customers'
eyes to a certain part of the menu and works by grouping
certain menu items together. This can be achieved by using
a border or box, or by placing similar items in a confined
space in the menu, for example, placing all the appetisers in
one box encourages customers to read them all as a unit.

7 Consumer psychology
As well as the features described above, which have a
positive impact, there are also some features of menu
design that can have a negative impact. Features that
have a negative impact are also discussed by Pavesic.
These include:
• Inadequate management commitment: not
investing enough time and effort into making sure
the menu design is as good as it could be, and not
realising how important an asset it can be.
• Hard to read: crowded pages or poor choice of font
size and style or colour of paper.
• Overemphasising prices: diners can dismiss certain
items based purely on price if this is not considered.
• Poor use of space: this includes not using the
front and back cover effectively, for example it is
important to include details about the restaurant
on the front page.
• Incongruence: if the menu doesn't fit the ambience
of the restaurant in terms of style, decor, etc. it isn't
going to work very well. If someone were to read
your menu somewhere else, it should give them a
feel for the type of place it represents.

The primacy effect and recency effect are two effects
found in memory research, which show that, if you are
recalling a list of words, the words at the start and end
of the list are more likely to be remembered than those
in the middle of the list. The same theory has been
investigated in relation to item position on a menu: are

Example study
Dayan and Bar-Hille! (2011) reported two studies which
manipulated the position of items on a menu to increase
or decrease the frequency of choice. They predicted that
items at the beginning and end of the menu would be
more likely to be ordered.
In the first study, 240 students were randomly allocated
to four conditions. These were four different menu
designs, differing only in terms of order of item
presentation within each category. The menus all offered
four appetisers (A), ten entrees (main courses, E), six
soft drinks (S) and eight desserts (D).
The names of the items and their descriptions were
copied from an Israeli pizza chain. No prices were
displayed. The four menus (in Hebrew) presented the
items in different orders within each category:
• baseline: arbitrarily ordered (no particular order)
• mirror: complete reverse of the baseline
• inside out baseline: reversed the baseline order
within the top and bottom half of each category
separately, therefore turning middle items into top/
bottom items and vice versa
• inside out mirror: as for the inside out baseline but
reversing the mirror version.
The participants were each given one version of the
menu and asked to choose one item from each of the
categories. The results showed that participants were
252)
significantly more likely to select items at the beginning
or end of the list than they were to select items placed
in the middle. Overall, the advantage of being listed at
the beginning and end was 56% (i.e. items listed at the
beginning or end were 56% more likely to be chosen
than items listed in the middle).
There was no significant difference in the impact of the
primacy effect and the recency effect; the number of items
chosen from the beginning of the list and those chosen
from the end of the list were almost exactly the same.
These results were convincing, but the researchers were
aware that this only represented a hypothetical choice
rather than one made in a real restaurant. To address
this criticism, they conducted a second study in a small
coffee shop in the centre of Tel Aviv over 30 days.
The coffee shop had 60 items on the menu in three
categories: coffee, soft drinks and desserts.
The baseline menu (the coffee shop's standard menu)
was alternated with the inside out version which
changed the position of items in the three categories
by exchanging items from the two ends of the category
with items from the middle. Staff recorded orders made
during this time and data from any customers who
ordered without reference to a menu were excluded.
There were 459 orders from the baseline menu and 492
from the inside out menu.
The mean advantage in this study was 55% and the
results confirmed the findings from Study 1. In Study 2
there was an even larger gain when an item was moved
from the exact middle to the extreme end (55%) than
when moved from the near middle to the near end
(51 %). The results also seemed to suggest an advantage
(59%) from being in the top half of the category
although this study did not use a mirror condition.
This research provides evidence that it is beneficial to
place items at the beginning or end of the category if
you want them to be ordered more often. This is most
likely to be used to encourage sales of higher profit
items, but the researchers also suggest that there may
be practical implications from this study in terms of
manipulating people's choices towards healthier options
(see Figure 7.9).

The effect of food name on menu item
choice
We have considered the effect of menu design in
terms of layout, font, and use of boxes, and we have
considered the effect of item position on a menu.
Last, we are going to discover whether the name that
is given to a dish can influence how likely it is to be
purchased.
Example study
Lockyer (2006) used focus groups, followed by a
survey, to gather data on the effect that different
words on a menu have on the food that people want
to buy. The four focus groups were made up of 48
self-selecting participants (of a mix of gender, age
and income) who responded to a letter asking them
to take part in the research. The survey was used
to measure the validity of the findings of the focus
groups and the 200 usable responses were those
returned from approximately 1800 that were sent out
to homes in the local New Zealand area (also a mix
of gender, age and income).
In the focus groups, participants were presented with
five different style menus, each including the same dishes
but described in very different ways. See Table 7.1 for
example wording of one of the dishes described on each
of the five different menus.

42% of participants rated menu 1 (French style) as 'very

unappealing' by 22% of participants. Lockyer now
wanted to find out the reasons behind the participants'
preferences so he asked them to write their reasons for
finding menus appealing and unappealing and then used
these notes and their ratings for a group discussion.
A content analysis was carried out, which involved the
discussions being transcribed and a computer program
used to count how often, and in what groupings, certain
words were used. Content analysis allows researchers
to turn qualitative data (such as verbal discussions)
into quantitative data (the most common words and
terms used) so that the information can be analysed and

better understood. The content analysis showed certain
groups of words that can tell us about the participants'
opinions. The words fresh, interesting' were grouped
together, telling us that the words used can give a
definite feeling for the menu, and that the items on the
menu were both 'fresh' and 'interesting'. Words such as
'trends, organic, season' and 'pure, natural, products'
were grouped together, indicating the importance of
current trends towards the importance of organic and
fresh ingredients. The occasion for the meal influenced
the importance of the general 'feeling' of the menu,
with the words 'mystique' and 'occasion' being grouped
together. Finally, words such as 'produce, actually,
expect' and 'understand, language, clear' were grouped
together, suggesting that the group found it important
that the language was clear and that it actually described
what the dish would be.
As the focus groups suggested that the occasion for the
meal would influence the menu choice, the survey asked
respondents to say which menu items they would choose
for different occasions, such as family reunion, romantic
dinner, business meeting or dinner with their motherin-law. The participants were also asked to comment
on the reasons for their choices, and a content analysis
was carried out to identify the most common reasons
for each menu choice. Unlike in the focus group, the
survey found menu 4 (elaborate style) to be the most
selected for all the dining experiences. For meal with
their mother-in-law menu 5 was the joint top choice and
for a business meeting menu 3 was the joint top choice.
Reasons for the choice of a chicken dish from each
menu include:
• Menu 1: Poulet saute chasseur: 'feels romantic',
'sounds sophisticated'
• Menu 2: Chicken sauteed in butter and served with
sauce chasseur: 'sounds delicious', 'appears to have
the nicest flavour'
• Menu 3: Spring chicken cooked and served in a new
season mushrooms, shallot and tomato flavoured
sauce: 'not too fussy', 'tells me basically what I get'
• Menu 4: The most tender chicken cooked till
golden and sewed with a delicious sauce finished
with tomatoes, shallots and mushrooms: 'mouthwatering', 'chicken sounds tender'
• Menu 5: Free range organic chicken cooked and
served with mushrooms, shallots and tomatoes in a
naturally produced sauce: 'organic', 'I like to know
what I'm eating'
These examples show that the way in which the dish
is described has an impact on the potential diner, and
influences their perception of the dish.
Overall, the results of Lockyer's research show that
the words used on a menu do have an impact on the
likelihood of potential diners to choose a dish. Most
participants showed a preference for items on the
menu that were clear, tasty and described as fresh and
natural. There were, however, broad differences in the
preferences of the participants so further research is
required to investigate this further.
ACTIVITY 7 .2
Create a menu for a new cafe, which is focusing
on promoting healthy eating.
Use research by Lockyer, Dayan and Bar-Hillel,
and Pavesic to help you.
You should consider the use of descriptive names,
position on the menu, and menu design features
that have a positive impact to encourage sales of
healthier options.
RESEARCH METHODS
Dayan and Bar-Hille! (2011) carried out a
laboratory experiment, which allows for high
levels of control, increasing the validity and the
reliability of the study. However, participants were
asked to look at a menu and make hypothetical
choices, which lacked ecological validity as it was
not showing the decision-making of customers in
real restaurants. To deal with the lack of ecological
validity, the researchers followed this study with
a field experiment where they changed the order
of the menu for a cafe to measure the effects on
customers' orders. These results supported the
findings of their first experiment, showing that the
results could be generalised to real life. 
ISSUES AND DEBATES
Research into menu design can be applied
to everyday life because it focuses on how an
effective menu design works, the importance
of the order of food items on the menu, and
even research into the effect of naming the food
differently. This evidence is only really important
and useful when it is applied to real life and
used by restaurants and cafes to make changes
to their menus and see the effect it has on their
businesses. It is particularly useful because they
can hopefully benefit greatly from what are
relatively simple and low cost changes, compared
to other aspects of their restaurant. "

","Consumer behaviour and
personal space
Personal space at restaurant tables
Personal space refers to the area surrounding a person,
which they consider to be psychologically theirs (as
discussed in Chapter 5), Personal space is extremely
important to most people, and people will feel
discomfort, anxiety or anger if their personal space is
invaded. Personal space is an important consideration for
any restaurant: there needs to be a balance between the
comfort of the customer and the profit of the restaurant.
In simple terms, the closer diners can sit to each other, the
more diners you will be able to fit in your restaurant and
therefore (in theory) the more profit you will be able to
make. However, customers will not want to feel that they
are crowded, or that their personal space is being invaded
as this will lead to a negative experience.
Hall outlines four zones of physical distance that
people may feel comfortable with, depending on the
circumstances (see Figure 7.10):
• Intimate distance: less than 18 inches (46 cm). For
touching or whispering, and with people we have a
close, most likely romantic connection to
• Personal distance: 18 inches--4 feet (46-122 cm).
For interactions between good friends and family
• Social distance: 4-12 feet (1.2-3.7 m).
For interactions with acquaintances
• Public distance: 12 feet (3.7 m) or more.
For public speaking or formal interactions

Figure 7 .10: Hall's four zones of personal space
This shows how complicated personal space
considerations can be in a restaurant, because people
will feel more comfortable seated closer to someone that
they are intimate with, than they would a friend, and
certainly than they would a stranger.
Responses to the invasion of our personal space can
be explained with reference to three concepts: overload,
arousal and behaviour constraint. The concept of
overload suggests that we maintain our personal space
to reduce (and to maintain control over) the amount of
information that needs to be dealt with. If people are
too close, we must process information relating to their
features, their smell, their body heat and possibly even
their touch. This produces an overload of information
to process as well as a lack of control over the
information that we process, producing feelings of stress.
The invasion of personal space can also be explained
by the concept of arousal. When our personal space
is invaded, we may feel a heightened sense of arousal.
Our response may be positive (such as at a concert, or if
someone hugs you) or it may be negative (such as a
stranger sitting too close).
The invasion of personal space can also be understood
in terms of behaviour constraint, which refers to having
your freedom to choose how to behave being taken away.
Research shows that crowds behave very differently from
individuals, often leading to increased aggression and a
decrease in prosocial or helping behaviours. It is possible
255 ) 
) CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL AS & A LEVEL PSYCHOLOGY: COURSEBOOK
that the stress experienced by lack of personal space
may be responsible for these changes in behaviour.

& Evans, G. W. (2011 ). Consumers' responses to

Context
Previous research has shown that diners need personal
space so that they don't feel overcrowded; if someone
invades their personal space, they will feel uncomfortable
and may show avoidance behaviours.
There are significant individual differences in terms of
how much personal space people need. It is generally
found that men and older people require more personal
space than women and younger people. The people you
are with will also affect the amount of personal space you
require as well, with larger groups requiring more space
per person than smaller groups (Knowles and Bassett
1976). Personal space also varies between cultures, and
between situations. Not only does personal space vary
between individuals, cultures and situations, it also varies
spatially. This means that personal space isn't like a round
bubble that surround a person in the centre, but that
the amount of personal space a person requires varies
depending on their position. Personal space generally
tends to be narrower on either side, but broader in front
or behind a person (Hayduk 1981), so an individual
would be happier having someone sit or stand close by
next to them rather than directly in front or behind them.
Main theories and explanations
When designing a restaurant there is a balance to be
struck between fitting in as many tables and chairs as
possible and making the restaurant a pleasant place to
be. It makes sense that, from a financial point of view, the
more tables and chairs you have in your restaurant, the
more customers you can fit in and therefore the money
you can make. However, research into personal space
is an important consideration because if people feel
that their personal space is being invaded they will feel
uncomfortable and will be less likely to stay for a long time
(and therefore spend less money) and will be less likely to
return to the restaurant or to recommend it to others.
Robson et al. hoped to develop the research into the
importance of personal space in diners by looking
more specifically at the space between tables rather than
previous research that has mostly focused on distance
between individual chairs or spacing around a table
(Sommer 1969).
Aims
The researchers aimed to find out how diners perceive
specific table distances during particular dining
experiences, and the impact that those perceptions have
on attitudes and preferences. Their aim was to give
the restaurant industry guidance on appropriate table
distances.
Design
A web-based questionnaire was used to gather diner
responses to images of restaurant tables at different
distances (see Figure 7.11). The independent variables
were table spacing (6, 12 or 24 inches (15, 30 or 60
cm)) and scenario (business, friend or romantic). The
dependent variables were the measures of emotional and
behavioural responses measured by Likert-type scales.
Participants were randomly allocated to one of the
nine conditions (combinations of three table spacings
and three scenarios). The same images, distances and
statements were used for each participant in each
condition, to control for any extraneous variables.
Figure 7 .11: Image similar to those shown in Robson
et al.'s study 6-inch table spacing
The sample consisted of just over 1000 participants
from the USA, with a good balance of gender and
location of residence (urban, suburban or rural), and
a range of age and ethnicity. The sampling technique
was volunteer sampling. 
The first part of the questionnaire asked about
gender, age, ethnicity, place of residence, restaurant
use frequency and whether they had worked in the
restaurant industry. The second part measured
emotional, intentional and anticipated behavioural
reactions to images of two tables 6, 12 or 24 inches
apart. Participants were told to imagine they were in
one of three scenarios: business, dining with a friend
or a romantic scenario. Likert-type scales (1 = strongly
disagree, 7 = strongly agree) were used on a series of
32 statements about their emotional and behavioural
responses to the images of the table spacings. The
statements relating to emotional responses were
derived from the Stress Arousal Check List (SACL): an
instrument that accurately reflects a respondent's stress
and arousal and clearly differentiates between the two.
The statements that relate to behavioural responses
included questions around the constructs of perceived
control, physical and sensory privacy, goal blocking and
general comfort. Perceived crowding was also measured.
Results, findings and conclusions
Results showed significant differences across almost all
responses for tables at 6-, 12- and 24-inches distance.
Close table spacing made respondents feel less private,
more crowded, less likely to have a positive experience
and more dissatisfied with their assigned table. Those
with the 6-inch distance were also more concerned
about being overheard or about disturbing other diners.
Arousal score did not vary significantly between table
spacing, but stress levels were significantly higher for the
6-inch spacing, and feelings of control and comfort were
markedly lower than for wider spaced tables.
The proposed scenario had a significant influence on dining
satisfaction. Those imagining a romantic scenario showed
significantly higher stress, less control and more discomfort
with the 6-inch spacing than 12-and 24-inch. Dining while
on business did not affect responses to tight table spacing
except in terms of comfort. Dining with a friend prompted
moderate stress and discomfort for tight spacing. There
were significant differences between genders; in general
women showed significantly more stress, less control and
greater discomfort than men, whereas men felt more
arousal at each distance. Frequent diners showed more
comfort across all table spacings than those who dined out
less frequently. There were some apparent differences in
response across age, location and ethnicity, but these were
not consistent and there were no significant interactions.
The researchers conclude that diners feel strongly
negatively towards tightly spaced tables of 6 inches,
7 Consumer psychology
in terms of feeling uncomfortable, overcrowded and
generally negative about the restaurant. 70% of diners
said they would have been asked to be re-seated if
they had been seated so closely to another table. The
common spacing of 12 inches was also less desirable
than those spaced further apart, especially for those
imagining a romantic scenario. This is important for
those in the restaurant business, as those who are seated
uncomfortably are likely to stay for less time (and likely
to spend less money), are less likely to return and less
likely to recommend the restaurant to others.
Evaluation
Robson et al.'s study had a large sample, with over
1000 participants. Most importantly, the sample had
a good balance of gender and location of residence
(urban, suburban or rural), and a range of age and
ethnicity. This is a representative sample, so the results
can be generalised to the wider population. However,
all participants were from the USA so the results may
not be applicable to people from other cultures. The
use of Likert-type scales is beneficial as it collects
quantitative data, allowing the data to be compared
and analysed. However, the disadvantage of using
Likert-type scales is that they don't allow participants
to offer more detailed answers, and they rely on
subjective interpretation of the scales. How might
qualitative data have been collected?
Robson et al.'s study into personal space in restaurant tables
is relevant to application to real life as the findings can be
used to help restaurants appeal to their customers. However,
alongside this, it is particularly important to consider
cultural differences as the study was carried out in the USA.
Research shows that there are significant differences across
cultures in terms how much personal space individuals
are comfortable with (Lornranz, 1976). It is important,
therefore that anyone wishing to use this research to help
them make decisions about the layout of their restaurant
should consider the implications of cultural differences.
Restaurants in different cultures may not be able to use
these findings confidently so it may be beneficial to consider
further research within their own culture as well.
Defending your place in a queue
Another issue that is related to personal space is the way
that people behave when they are in a queue. Research
has shown that people are very protective of their
position in a queue and there are certain expectations
that we have about the behaviour of other people in the
queue. For example, someone pushing into a queue goes

KEYWORDS
social structure: a system where there are certain
rules and expectations that people are expected
to follow when they are part of this system
confederate: someone who is involved in the
study but acts as if they are not
against the behaviour that most people expect, and is
seen as unacceptable. However, there are many factors
that may influence a person's response to someone
pushing into a queue. The nature of the intrusion
is important, as is the number of people who are
intruding. We need to also consider the social structure
of a queue.
ACTIVITY 7.3
Before reading the example study by Milgram
et al., consider how you would react if someone
pushed in front of you in a queue. What might
you say or do? What factors would affect how you
reacted? Think about how they pushed in, what
you were queuing for, how long you had been
queuing, how other people reacted, as well as
any other factors. How do you think most people
would react to someone pushing into a queue?
When you have come up with your own ideas
discuss with a partner.
Example study
Milgram et al. (1986) carried out a series of field
experiments in a range of settings in New York City,
such as train stations, convenience shops, etc. A
confederate calmly approached a point between the
third and fourth person in the queue and said in a
neutral tone 'excuse me; I would like to get in here'. The
confederate would then simply join the queue without
waiting for a response. If the confederate was explicitly
asked to leave the queue they would do so, otherwise
they would remain for l minute before leaving. An
observer stood nearby, ready to record physical, verbal
and non-verbal reactions to the intrusion. There was a
total of 129 intrusions carried out and observed.
The researchers also varied the number of intruders:
sometimes one and sometimes two. They also used
buffers: these were confederates who passively occupied
a position between the point of intrusion and the next
258)
Figure 7 .12: A queue is a social system and intruders are
not acceptable
naive queuer (the next person who is unaware of the
study taking place). This was designed to see if the
responsibility for objecting would be displaced from the
person immediately at the point of intrusion to others.
In some conditions, two buffers were used standing
immediately behind each other. Therefore, there are two
independent variables: number of intruders ( one or two)
and number of buffers (zero, one or two) resulting in six
experimental conditions (see Figure 7.12).
Results showed that queuers behind the intruder were
far more likely to object than those who were ahead of
the intruder. Two intruders provoked a much greater
reaction than one, and buffers dampened the queue's
response to the intruder. Verbal objections (from polite
to hostile, demanding the intruder leave or go to the
back of the queue) were the most common, occurring in
21.7% of queues. Generalised expressions of disapproval
were also included in this category and included more
tentative comments such as 'excuse me, this is a queue'.
Physical action (such as tapping the shoulder, tugging
a sleeve or even pushing the intruder out of the queue)
against the intruder happened in 10% of queues. This
type of response normally originated from the person
standing immediately behind the intruder. Non-verbal
objections included disapproving looks, hostile glares
and gestures to the intruder to move to the end of the
queue. They occurred in 14.7% of queues.
Milgram et al. conclude that the queue is considered to
be a social system with a shared set of beliefs governing
the behaviour of the participants. The queue acts as
a way of instilling social order: individuals who are
waiting for a service expect that those who approach
after them will wait their turn. Most people believe 
that it is not acceptable to break the expected norms
and push into a queue. We would all rath~r buy ou~ .
ticket (or whatever we are queuing for) without waitmg
but we accept that if we were the ones waiting, we
would expect others to take their place in the queue.
We accept this social system and follow the rules. If
someone were to push into a queue, it is not just the
extra time an individual would need to wait that is the
problem: depending on the nature of the queue it could
only add seconds to a wait time. It is more than that;
the anger and frustration felt comes from the injustice
surrounding the fact that someone violated the rules of
the social system (the queue) (Cooley, 1902).
A social system needs to be defended, otherwise order
cannot be maintained. So, if there is a threat to the
order of the system, by someone intruding, those in
the queue must defend themselves. As Milgram's study
showed, the queue does not act as a whole and defend
their queue; instead it is thought to be the responsibility
of those behind the intruder, and very much so of the
individual directly behind the intrusion. Finally, the
defence of the queue is almost always normative (based
on expectations of the group), with individuals most
likely to simply point out 'this is a queue' or tell the
intruder 'you can't push in here'.
RESEARCH METHODS
The use of observation to gather data in Milgram
et al.'s study has both strengths and weaknesses.
Covert observation allows the observer to record
people's natural behaviour, as they do not know
they are being observed so they won't change
their behaviour as a result. However, with covert
observations there are ethical issues because,
if people don't know they are being observed_
they cannot give informed consent and there 1s
the issue of deception. Observation is also a way
of measuring how people actually respond in a
situation, as opposed to a self-report method
where people may give a socially desirable answer
about how they think they would respond to
someone pushing into a queue. A weakness of
the observation is that it is subjective, and the
observer may miss something. Observer bias may
occur, where the person involved in the research is
more likely to interpret something in a way that it
confirms the hypothesis. This reduces the reliability
of the observation, particularly as there was only
one observer so there is nobody to compare results
with to check for inter-observer reliability.
7 Consumer psychology
ISSUES AND DEBATES
Research into personal space and queuing are
particularly subject to cultural differences as they
are both behaviours that vary between cultures.
Milgram et al.'s research into queue jumping was
carried out in New York City, so the results may
only be representative of the city itself but would
likely apply to the rest of the USA fairly accurately.
However, other cultures around the world
would likely respond differently when faced with
someone intruding into their queue, so the results
should be generalised with caution.
The research by Robson et al. highlights the
importance of individual explanations when
considering personal space. The research showed
that factors such as gender, age and ethnicity
were all important influences on someone's
feelings about personal space. This is an
important consideration in comparison to the
more likely consideration of situational factors,
such as whether the meal is romantic or business"

Consumer decision-making
Models of consumer decision-making
There are many different models of consumer decisionmaking, here we will consider three: utility theory,
satisficing and prospect theory.
Utility theory was proposed by Von Neumann and
Morgenstern (1944) cited in Von Neumann and
Morgenstern (2007). The theory suggests that, when
making a decision, consumers make the decision
rationally. The decision is based on optimising the likely
outcomes of their actions. For example, if you were
deciding on a new car, utility theory would predict that

Figure 7 .13: Utility theory suggests that we make

on all the variables
260)
you would evaluate every available car against all the
important variables (cost, size, mileage, make, etc.) and
then select the car that scored highest on all of these
variables (see Figure 7.13). However, in reality this is not
practical, and it is unlikely that consumers are as rational
as this model predicts or even that they are aware of the
process of decision-making within a retail environment.
Simon (1956) proposed an alternative model called
satisficing in which he describes consumers as getting
'approximately where they wanted to go' and then stopping
the decision-making process. Continuing the example of
buying a new car, from a satisficing point of view, you
might look at a few cars and stop the process when you
find one that is 'good enough'. Although this model may
explain behaviour more accurately than utility theory, it
still does not offer a good predictor of consumer behaviour
that can be effectively used in a retail environment.
Prospect theory was developed by Kahneman and Tversky,
in the 1970s. Their theory added two new concepts to the
explanation of consumer decision-making; these were
value (rather than utility in the earlier utility model) and
endowment, which is when an item is more precious when
owned than when owned by someone else. This suggests
that people value gains and losses in different ways and are
more likely to base their decisions on perceived likelihood
of gains rather than perceived likelihood of losses. For
example, we buy a lottery ticket because we might win, not
because we are highly likely to lose.

Strategies of consumer decision-making
The next development in consumer decision-making
was the identification of several possible consumer
decision-making strategies that could be exploited by
those working in consumer fields. These are described 
as: compensatory strategies, non-compensatory strategies
and partially compensatory strategies (Green et al.,
1973). Consumers may use any of the strategies,
and may vary between strategies, depending on the
individual and depending on the purchase.
KEYWORDS
compensatory strategies: a strategy where
the value of one attribute can be allowed to
compensate for another
non-compensatory strategies: a strategy where
each attribute is evaluated individually
partially compensatory strategies: a strategy
where items are considered in relation to one
another in terms of important attributes
In compensatory strategies, a consumer will allow the
value of one attribute to compensate for another. Again,
in terms of buying a new car, you might decide that a
very low mileage compensates for the fact that this was
not your first choice of make or your preferred colour.
Alternatively, you may choose the car based on the
colour, allowing this to compensate for the high mileage.
Richarme (2005) describes two compensatory strategies:
• Equal Weight Strategy, where attributes are seen
as being equally important. For example, someone
buying a car might find mileage and colour to be of
equal importance.
• Weighted Additive Strategy, where some attributes
are seen as more important than others. For
example, someone might value the low mileage on a
car much more highly than the make or the colour.
In non-compensatory strategies each attribute is
evaluated individually, rather than allowing one variable
to compensate for another. So, in terms of buying a new
car, even if it was a good price, the ideal make and had
a low mileage, it would be immediately discounted if it
was not the correct colour.
Simon suggests that there are three non-compensatory
strategies:
• Satisficing: the first product to meet the
basic requirements is chosen and no further
consideration takes place. For example, if an
essential piece of household equipment fails, such
as a kettle, someone might simply purchase the first
kettle they see.
7 Consumer psychology
• Elimination by aspects: this strategy sets a 'cutoff' value for the most important attribute and
then allows everything that meets that attribute to
remain under consideration. The remaining items
are then assessed against the next attribute and so
on. For example, when buying a kettle, you might
decide on the minimum capacity so anything of at
least that capacity is considered, then you might
consider another factor, such as efficiency, for the
remaining kettles.
• Lexigraphic: the most important attribute is
evaluated and if one item is considered superior in
terms of this attribute, this immediately stops the
decision-making process, and the item is chosen.
If one item does not emerge as superior on the
most important attribute, then the consideration
moves to the next attribute and so on. For example,
you need to buy a kettle but have a large family so
you decide you will get the kettle with the biggest
capacity, and won't consider other factors.
Consumers may use a partially compensatory strategy,
a middle ground between compensatory and noncompensatory.
Two partially compensatory strategies are:
• Majority of Conforming Dimensions: an individual
using this strategy would evaluate two products
against all relevant attributes and keep the one that
does best. This one is then compared to the next
product and so on until there is only one product
left. For example, you might look at two kettles and
compare them on price, and disregard the more
expensive one, then compare the cheaper one with
another and so on.
• Frequency of Good and Bad Features: all products
are compared to the appropriate cut-off values
and the product that has the most positive features
exceeding the cut-off values will be chosen. For
example, comparing all kettles on important
factors, such as capacity, efficiency and price, and
choosing the one that looks the best across all
factors.
Decision-making strategies applied to
internet shopping
In the previous section we looked at the three decisionmaking strategies (compensatory, non-compensatory
and partially compensatory) used by consumers. Here
we will consider how those three strategies apply to
internet shopping, and specifically to website design.

Example study
Jedetski et al. (2002) were interested to discover the
decision-making strategies used by consumers buying
online. It was predicted that consumers would use
compensatory strategies when buying from a website
designed to allow comparison of items but would
use non-compensatory strategies when this wasn't
available. They also predicted that the number of
alternatives available would influence which decisionmaking strategy was used. Each of the 24 participants
was asked to read a document about the decisionmaking strategies (three compensatory and three
non-compensatory strategies) and then given a quiz to
test their understanding. Participants then went to one
of two websites, each with quite different designs, and
were shown how lists of alternatives could be found,
refined and so on, and were asked to speak aloud their
process as they made a decision on which item they
would buy. Immediately afterwards, the participant
was given a questionnaire about their decision-making
strategy, how satisfied or frustrated they were and
how confident they felt about their decision. The
experimenter recorded information about which item
was selected, how many alternatives there were and
how long the decision took. This was repeated for four
different items for each participant (although each
participant used only one website).
Results showed that, as expected, participants
used significantly more compensatory strategies on
CompareNet (a website design that uses technology
allowing comparisons of items to be made) and
more non-compensatory strategies on Jango (a
website design that does not allow comparisons of
items). Furthermore, the number of alternatives
affected strategies used: with participants using more
compensatory strategies for items with fewer than 30
alternatives and more non-compensatory strategies
for items with more than 100 alternatives. There was
not a significant difference between compensatory and
non-compensatory strategies in terms of confidence,
satisfaction, frustration, perceived time or actual time.
Participants were, however, more satisfied when using
CompareNet than when using Jango; suggesting that
website designs that use technology for comparisons are
more satisfying for consumers.

RESEARCH METHODS
Jedetski et al. (2002) used an independent
measures design, where each participant used
only one of the two websites for their task.
Results were then compared between the
groups of participants in each condition. One
strength of an independent measures design is
that there is no risk of order effects (as could be
the case with repeated measures) and it is less
likely the participants will work out the aim of
the experiment (as they could do with repeated
measures), both of which increase the validity
of the experiment. However, one weakness
of independent measures is that one group
of participants is compared to another group
or participants, instead of being compared to
themselves. This means that participant variables
could affect the results; it could be that the
participants in one condition just happen to be
different in terms of their decision-making styles
for example. Finally, a limitation recognised
by Jedetski et al. was the fact that participants
were informed of the different decision-making
strategies before the main task. This was done
so that the participants could describe the
strategy they were using, but it had the negative
consequence of reducing the ecological validity
of the study. By learning about the strategies first,
this meant that we are less likely to be seeing the
natural way in which the participant; would have
carried out this task in a real-life situation.
ISSUES AND DEBATES
Research into the different models of consumer
decision-making take a nomothetic approach.
The models aim to offer a universal set of rules
explaining why the population behaves in a
particular way and uses research to gather lots
of data to make these proposals. This can be
a useful approach as it enables us to have a
good understanding about the way people
will likely behave, and to allow predictions and
expectations. Furthermore, because the research
is based on gathering large amounts of data, it is
likely to be accurate for the most part. However,
this contrasts with an idiographic approach, 
CONTINUED
which looks at everyone as an individual and
would seek to find out detail about an individual's
personal circumstances to truly understand their
behaviour. This would, of course, allow for a
more specific and highly accurate account for an
individual's behaviour but doesn't allow for the
practical aspects of a nomothetic approach. Why
should cultural differences be considered when
investigating consumer decision-making? "

Heuristics
We are constantly making decisions and have developed
cognitive processing strategies or shortcuts to help us
make decisions more easily. These are called heuristics.
We are likely to use different heuristics for different sorts
of decisions, and may use more than one for a particular
decision. Heuristics are usually helpful as they aid our
decision-making, but they can also lead to errors in
judgement.
KEY WORD
heuristics: mental shortcuts that can help us
when making decisions but can lead to errors
in judgement
Availability heuristics
Availability heuristics are mental shortcuts based on
how easy it is to bring something to mind. They are
often useful ways of thinking about situations and can
be beneficial, for example, by making us more cautious
in dangerous situations as we can easily bring examples
of negative outcomes to mind. However, this is often
based on inaccurate information or faulty thinking.
Hoyer et al. (2010) suggest that if you had bought a
DVD player that kept breaking down, your 'available'
perception of that brand is likely to be a negative
one, so you would be unlikely to purchase from that
company again. Communication from others might
also create an availability heuristic. If your friend had
problems with a particular make, then this information
is likely to influence your thinking even though this
may be an isolated instance. This occurs because we
ignore base rate information - how often something
7 Consumer psychology
really occurs - in favour of information that is readily
available or easily memorable.
Representativeness heuristics
Representativeness heuristics are mental shortcuts that
allow us to make judgements by making comparisons
with the best-known (most representative) example of
a category. If, for example, we are looking for a mobile
phone, we are likely to compare a newly released model
to the current market leader. If it appears similar,
then we are likely to assume that this is also a quality
product. Manufacturers take advantage of the fact
that we use this heuristic, by making products ( or their
packaging) look like an established product so that the
consumer assumes they will be similar.
Recognition heuristics
Recognition heuristics are used when we are, for
example, choosing between two items or two brands.
In this case if you are familiar with one of them (you
recognise it), but not the other, you will assume the
recognised one has more value, and it will therefore
be chosen. For example, choosing between brands
of mobile phones, if the specification and details are
exactly the same for two phones but one of them is a
familiar brand, you will choose that one over the other.
Take-the-best heuristics
Take-the-best heuristics allow a decision to be made
based on one single 'good' reason only. When choosing
between several options the decision-maker will make
their choice based on one attribute that seems to
best discriminate between the items, ignoring other
information that is available. In the example of buying a
mobile phone, there are lots of factors that are important
(price, camera, appearance, size, etc.) but the 'take-thebest' heuristic would mean you would base your decision
on the one factor you think is most important, ignoring
all others, so you might choose the phone that has the
best camera, regardless of anything else.
Anchoring
Anchoring describes our tendency to give the most
importance to the first bit of information we receive
about something, regardless of what further information
we gather. This means that the decisions we make are
based on adjustments of that first piece of information,
but that that starting point has a huge impact on the
final decision. For example, you are going to buy a new
car and you see online what the average price for that
car is. If you go to the dealership and the price is slightly
under that price you will jump at the chance to spend
263) 
) CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL AS & A LEVEL PSYCHOLOGY: COURSEBOOK
that money. However, if you had seen a lower price
online you would likely have bargained the price down
and saved yourself some money.
ACTIVITY 7 .4
Imagine you are buying a new mobile phone, which
heuristics do you think you would use? How do you
think they would help in your decision-making?
Point of purchase decisions
There are many factors that can influence our decisionmaking at the point of purchase. These include multiple
unit prices and suggestive selling. Multiple unit prices
involve offering a reduced price if you buy several of an
item, for example a bottle of water might cost $1 per
bottle but the multiple unit price could be $4 for five
bottles. This can work in retail environments to increase
sales by making consumers see a larger than normal
purchase as attractive. It can even work when there is no
price difference per item, e.g. a product may have a sign
saying, 'On Sale - 6 cans for $3', which is more effective
than a sign saying, 'On Sale - 50c', even though the price
per item is the same. This effect may be due to customers
expecting the multiple unit price to be cheaper.
Suggestive selling involves anything where the customer
has something 'suggested' to them in order to encourage
sales. This could be displaying earrings that match
a necklace and a suggestion that the two are bought
together, or a waitress suggesting a diner might like a
salad with her main course.
KEYWORDS
multiple unit prices: a promotion where a
reduced price is offered if you buy several of an
item
suggestive selling: an attempt to encourage
sales by 'suggesting' something to the customer,
e.g. earrings that match a necklace
Example study
Wansink et al. (1998) examined factors that might
influence how many units of a product a consumer
chooses to buy.
They suggested how point of purchase promotions
could increase sales. The paper reported on two field
264)
experiments and two laboratory experiments (we will
look at one of each), investigating the effect of multiple
unit prices and suggestive selling.
Wansink et al. (1998) conducted a one-week field
experiment comparing multiple-unit pricing with
single-unit promotional pricing in 86 stores. The
same size shelf label was used, and it displayed the
original price (99 cents) as well as either the singleunit promotion price (75 cents) or the multiple unit
price (2 for $1.50). Thirteen common food items were
included in the experiment.
The results showed that multiple unit promotional
prices resulted in a 32% increase in sales over the singleunit control. For 12 of 13 products, sales were higher
with multiple unit pricing, and for nine products the
difference was statistically significant (see Figure 7.14).
Figure 7 .14: Multiple unit prices encourage consumers to
spend more
However, because no self-report data were gathered,
we can't be sure of the reasons for the increased
sales (it could be that the shoppers were confused).
Furthermore, because data only showed sales, not how
many items each customer bought, we don't know if
more people bought the items or if the same number of
customers bought more items.
The next study examined the effect of suggestive
selling: in this case, in the form of suggesting a new and
innovative way to enjoy the items, such as 'Snickers bars
- buy them for your freezer'. It also examined the effect
of these suggestive selling slogans when accompanied
with or without a price discount.
The study involved a shopping scenario, where 120
undergraduates were offered six well-known products
at one of three price levels: an actual convenience store 
price (no discount), a 20% discount and a 40% discount.
Participants were given suggestive selling claims that
included either no product quantity anchor ('Snickers
bars - buy them for your freezer') or an explicit product
quantity anchor ('Snickers bars - buy 18 for your
freezer'). Participants were given no indication whether
the price was a discount and were asked to provide
purchase quantity intentions for all products.
The results showed that both the suggestive selling and
the discount level increased purchase quantity intentions,
and that the suggestive selling increased intended purchase
quantities even without a discount. Including the product
quantity anchor increased purchase quality intentions,
and this was effective even without a discount.
Decision-making styles
Earlier in this section we looked at different heuristics
that are involved in decision-making, and we are now
going to revisit the recognition and take-the-best
heuristics, alongside five decision-making styles.
According to Scott and Bruce (1995) there are five
decision-making styles:
1 Rational: making decisions in a logical way, where
various options are considered to achieve a specific
goal.
2 Intuitive: making decisions that 'feel right'; trusting
3
your intuition.
Dependent: consulting others and relying on their
assistance when making a decision.
4 Avoiding: putting off decisions or making decisions
only at the last minute.
5 Spontaneous: making quick and impulsive decisions.
The instrument devised by Scott and Bruce to measure
decision-making styles does not assign everyone to
one style. Instead, it gives each person a score in each
dimension, indicating how much their individual style
resembles each of the five styles.
The use of a heuristic has been shown to be influenced
by the task and context (situational factors: Payne et al.,
1993) and by personal factors, such as intelligence and
personality traits (e.g. neuroticism). Time pressure is a
particular factor that has been shown to increase the
likelihood of using a heuristic (Hilbig et al., 2012).
Example study
del Campo et al. (2016) were interested to study the
relationship between heuristics and decision-making
styles, as this specific relationship has not been researched
7 Consumer psychology
previously. Their study included two experiments: one
in Vienna and one in Madrid. In total, there were 320
participants, with a wide range of ages and approximately
equal split of men and women. Participants were asked
to complete a computer-based task where they were
asked to choose between five different options of eggs
and were either given a time pressure ( 40 seconds to
make the decision) or no time pressure. Four of the egg
options were designed to target a particular heuristic or
type of response: one targeted the take-the-best heuristic,
one the recognition heuristic, one triggered an emotional
response and one required higher cognitive processing.
The fifth option did not target a specific behaviour (see
Figure 7.15). Following the task, participants were given
a questionnaire asking questions about their reasons for
the decision, their buying behaviours, their attitudes to the
products and so on. Each participant also completed Scott
and Bruce's instrument to determine the dimensions of
their decision-making style.

Results showed that there were many differences
between the two experiments, so these cultural
differences need to be further investigated. In the
Vienna Experiment, time pressure led to a significant
shift from 'cognitive' to 'take-the-best' options,
however this was not the case in the Madrid
ExperiU:ent, which suggests there is only limited
evidence that time pressure increases the likelihood
of using heuristics. Furthermore, in the Vienna
Experiment, those who scored high on the spontaneous
style were more likely to choose the 'recognition'
product than the 'cognitive' one, as expected.
Unexpected, however, is that those who scored high
on the rational style chose the 'take-the-best' option
more often than the 'cognitive' one, regardless of time
pressure. In Madrid, those scoring high in the rational
decision style were less likely to choose the 'take-thebest' product, compared to the 'cognitive', without
time pressure, but this is reversed with time pressure.
RESEARCH METHODS
The first study by Wansink et al. was a field
experiment, so it had high ecological validity and
showed people's consumer behaviour in a natural
setting. However, because it did not involve any
self-report, there are no qualitative data so we
cannot know about the thoughts or feelings that
the consumers were experiencing. This limits how
useful the study is because only quantitative data
were gathered (in terms of how many purchases
were made), but we cannot know the reasons
behind the change in purchases. Their second
experiment is flawed because they only included
students, so we cannot generalise the results to
the wider population. This is particularly important
for an area such as consumer behaviour, because
people from different sorts of households and with
different budgets and priorities will be expected
to show different consumer behaviour. How could
Wansink et al. have improved their study?
ISSUES AND DEBATES
Research into point of purchase decisions, such
as that by Wansink et al., is particularly applicable
to real life because it shows the effectiveness
of different promotions and selling techniques.
This is useful for shop owners as they can use the
information gathered from this research to maximise

sales and profit, and to target certain products
that they may, for example, have an excess
of. The information could also be useful for
consumers, however, because this would allow
them to understand the psychology behind these
promotions and it may help them to think about
whether they are really going to benefit from the
offers or not. "

Thinking fast and thinking slow/System
1 and System 2
Kahneman's (2011) book Thinking, Fast and Slow presents
his 40 years of research into the theory of thinking and
has been summarised and reviewed by Shleifer (2012).
According to Kahneman, there are two different systems
used for thinking: System l and System 2. System
1 thinking corresponds to 'thinking fast', involving
automatic, intuitive, unconscious and effortless thinking.
System 1 thinking relies on associations and heuristics,
rather than on statistical analysis or consideration
of evidence. On the other hand, System 2 thinking
corresponds to 'thinking slow', it is conscious, controlled
and deliberate. System 2 thinking relies on statistical
analysis and requires time and attention so it is costly to
use. Kahneman and Tversky claim that System 1 describes
'normal' decision-making and is the approach most of us
take to making decisions, most of the time. This not only
applies to small and insignificant decisions but also to
bigger decisions such as investments and purchases. System
1 is useful because it is quick and effortless so it allows for
our lives to be easier. Often, System 1 thinking works out
well but because of the lack of deliberate and conscious
tho~ght, sometimes it can lead to errors. This does not
mean that we are incapable of System 2 thought, but that
we don't use it very often. This may be why it is so difficult
to make accurate predictions about decision-making.
KEYWORDS
System 1 thinking: 'thinking fast', involving
automatic, unconscious thinking, which is nonstatistical and uses associations
System 2 thinking: 'thinking slow', involving
conscious controlled thinking, which is deliberate
and costly to use 
An example to demonstrate the difference in System 1
and System 2 thinking comes from one of Kahneman
and Tversky's best-known experiments. In the
experiment, Americans were asked to respond to this
statement: 'Steve is very shy and withdrawn, invariably
helpful but with very little interest in people or in the
world of reality. A meek and tidy soul, he has a need for
order and structure, and a passion for detail.' Is Steve
more likely to be a librarian or a farmer?
The most common response would come from System
1 thinking. Steve is more likely to be a librarian than a
farmer because he sounds more like a librarian than a
farmer. However, this has ignored the facts that there
are at least five times as many farmers in the USA as
there are librarians, and that male librarians in the USA
are even less common. Therefore, a response from the
System 2 approach would be that it is much more likely
that Steve is a farmer, rather than a librarian.
Kahneman claims that adding two and two, completing
the words 'bread and ... ' and driving a car on an empty
road are all examples of System 1 thinking. They require
a quick, intuitive response with little effort, and usually
get the right answer. However, the previous example of
Steve shows that System 1 can sometimes lead to errors.
There are some difficulties when considering System 1 and
System 2 thinking. First, the parameters of these systems
will vary between people. Kahneman uses an example of
calculating 20 x 20 to demonstrate that, for some people
(such as mathematicians) this is a System 1 effortless task,
whereas for others it would rely on System 2, effortful
thinking. Another difficulty with the systems is that we
focus on the errors that tend to occur as a result of System
1 thinking, however, System 2 is not flawless, and can
also lead to errors. Considering the example of 20 x 20,
even using System 2 and spending time and effort on the
calculation, some people will still make an error. Therefore,
if we see an error in thinking or decision-making, it is not
obvious whether the error is due to System 1, System 2
or a combination of the two. A third problem with the
relationship between System 1 and System 2 comes from
the idea that most of the information that is considered
during System 2 comes from System 1. If the full or correct
information is not 'sent' from System 1 to System 2 then
what prompts System 2 to engage? To use the example
of Steve, what would actually trigger someone to engage
System 2 thinking and consider the ratio of male librarians
to farmers? There are many questions that remain
unclear or unanswered in terms of how the two systems
are distinguished from another and how they work with
one another.
7 Consumer psychology
Choice blindness
Key study: Hall et al. (2010)
Hall, L., Johansson, P., Taming, B., Sikstrom, S.,
& Deutgen, T. (2010). Magic at the marketplace:
choice blindness for the taste of jam and the smell
of tea. Cognition, 117(1 ), 54-61.
Context
Choice blindness is an example of an error in decisionmaking. This occurs when someone doesn't notice
the difference between what they have chosen and the
outcome they get. Johansson et al. (2005) investigated
choice blindness by asking participants to select
which of two photos of women's faces they found
most attractive. The photos were then surreptitiously
swapped over, and the participant was asked to defend
their choice and explain why they found their chosen
photo more attractive (while being presented with the
other photo). Participants only noticed that there was
something wrong with their choice in 26% of trials.
If the processing of faces was subject to choice blindness
it is reasonable to expect that the same could be applied
to other visual processing. However, Hall et al. were
interested to discover whether choice blindness extended
beyond human faces and other visual processing. They
were interested in whether choice blindness would apply
to other decision-making, and specifically, would it
apply to consumer decision-making in a real-life setting.
KEYWORD
choice blindness: refers to a person's inability
to notice mismatches between intention and
outcome in a decision
Main theories and explanations
Choice blindness is a complex phenomenon, without a
clear explanation. There has been a great interest in the
importance of implicit or 'non-conscious' influence in
consumer decision-making. One example of an implicit
influence is preference fluency; how easy or difficult the
consumer perceives the choice to be. Another implicit
influence is placebo effect of marketing, where people
tend to believe that a product will be less effective if it is
purchased at a reduced price.
267 > 
) CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL AS & A LEVEL PSYCHOLOGY: COURSEBOOK
As well as these implicit influences, our decision-making
is also affected by explicit influences, in other words
making a decision based on what you actually see and
hear relating to the product itself. Choice blindness
then is interesting because it considers the interaction
between explicit choices (the decision you make initially)
and implicit changes (the surreptitious switching of
your choice). Studying choice blindness allows us to
gain insight into the decision-making processes that
occurred at the time, as well as the extent to which we
are consciously aware of these afterwards.
Aims
The aim was to investigate whether choice blindness
would be shown with consumer decision-making in a
naturalistic setting.
Design
The study was a field experiment, where a tasting venue
was set up at a supermarket. The sample consisted of 180
participants, of which 118 were female, and with an age
range of 16-80 years, at a supermarket in Sweden. This
was opportunity sampling, as participants were asked if
they would like to be involved in a quality control test for
pairs of teas and jams (see Figure 7.16). Each participant
was asked to taste the jam and smell the tea and say which
of each pair they preferred. For each participant either the
jam or the tea condition was manipulated. Half were told
they would receive the chosen tea or jam as a thank you
gift. For each participant, the order of presentation, the
type of manipulation and which jams and teas were used
were randomly allocated.
Figure 7 .16: Participants tasted pairs of jams and chose
their favourite
268)
Experimenter 1 asked the questions, took notes and
managed the recording device, while experimenter
2 conducted the preference test. In the manipulated
condition the participant was presented with the two
jars of jam or tea and asked to sample the first one and
rate how much they liked it on a scale of 1-10. While
they were rating it, experimenter 2 surreptitiously turned
the jar upside down so that now the other sample was
present (this was created by having two jars attached
to each other bottom to bottom, each with a screw on
lid and a paper label covering the join so it looked like
a normal jar). The participant was asked to sample the
other option and again while rating it, experimenter 2
turned it upside down. Participants were now asked to
taste their preferred sample again, defend their choice,
and indicate on a ten-point scale how difficult they
found the decision and how confident they were in their
choice. After the participant had completed the tea
and jam pairing, they were asked if they felt there was
anything odd or unusual about the set up or about the
sampled alternatives. They were then fully debriefed and
had the full aim explained, and were asked again if they
suspected any manipulation.
There were three criteria for detection of the
manipulation: concurrent detection (if the participant
noticed anything unusual immediately after tasting
or smelling the manipulated jam or tea), retrospective
detection (where the participant claimed to have noticed
the deception after the experiment, either before or after
debriefing) and sensory-change detection (where, even
if the participants did not report noticing anything,
they made any comments about the change in taste or
smell after the manipulation). Those with a concurrent
detection completed the taste study but their results
were not included in the results analysis.
Results, findings and conclusions
Only 14.4% of the jam and 13.8% of the tea trials were
detected concurrently, 6.2% of the jam and 6.9% of
the tea trials were detected retrospectively, and 12.4%
of the jam and 11.5% of the tea trials were recorded
as sensory-change detection. In total, 33.3% of the
manipulated jam trials and 32% of the manipulated
tea trials were detected. In contrast to predictions,
those offered the tea as a gift were less likely to detect
any manipulation than those who were not offered a
gift. There were no differences based on incentives for
jam. There were no differences in perceived ease of
distinguishing between the two samples, or confidence in
decision (for tea or jam) between the non-manipulation
trials and the manipulation trials where there was 
no detection. Overall rating for perceived ease of
distinguishing between the two samples, and confidence
rating, was notably high for both jam and tea.
The results supported the main prediction: no more than a
third of manipulation trials were detected by participants.
This shows that, for most trials, participants were blind
to the mismatch between intended and actual outcome
of their choice, and instead believed that the taste or
smell in their final sample matched their initial choice.
Furthermore, in two-thirds of detected trials, participants
didn't react at the time of tasting the manipulated sample,
instead this only happened later, or through an expression
of sensory change. Even for vastly different tastes such as
cinnamon-apple and grapefruit, or smells such as mango
and Pernod (strong aniseed smell), detections were made
in less than half of trials, and no more than one-fifth were
detected concurrently. One aspect that makes the findings
so interesting is that, for non-manipulated trials and for
non-detected manipulated trials the ease of distinguishing
between the two samples scored high on the ten-point
scale (7.3 for jam and 8.0 for tea). This shows that the
non-detection could not just be that participants found
it difficult to tell the samples apart; in fact, they found it
easy to distinguish between the two, but they still could
not detect the manipulation. Finally, although some may
argue that this is a low-stakes decision, those who were
offered the free gift were actually less likely to notice the
manipulation than those who were not offered a gift. This
suggests that choice blindness still remains at a significant
level even when faced with real-world consequences.
Evaluation
Hall et al. used opportunity sampling for their field
experiment. They set up a tasting stall at a supermarket
and asked passers-by to take part in taste-testing. A
strength of opportunity sampling is that it is quick, easy
and convenient. By using whoever happens to be present
it means the researchers don't need to spend time and
resources trying to get a sample of participants, as with
some other methods. Another strength is that there is
likely to be a reasonable spread of people; in the case
of Hall et al. there was an age range of 16-80, and a
mix of men and women. A weakness of opportunity
sampling, however, is that you don't have control over
who the sample will be so you cannot ensure it is fully
representative, or that there are any particular types of
people. The use of pilot testing allowed for the researchers
to use samples of jam and tea that they knew were
easy to distinguish from one another. This is really
important for increasing the validity of the study as we
can be confident that the reason for participants not
7 Consumer psychology
noticing a manipulation was not just that it was hard to
distinguish between the two, but instead that it was due to
choice blindness.
Hall et al.'s research is applicable to real life because
it helps us to understand the role of choice blindness.
Although this was a low-stakes situation, where there were
not any repercussions because of the choice blindness,
it is still an important phenomenon to be aware of.
There could be situations in real life where the stakes are
higher and possible repercussions could be significant
so understanding choice blindness may be relevant. For
example, if somebody was a witness to a crime and they
incorrectly identified a suspect from a set of photos, but
then at trial they defended their choice, despite possible
evidence to the contrary.
Consumer memory for advertising
Advertising is a really important tool for selling
products, but adverts can only work if consumers
remember them. It was first thought that memory
simply fades over time, so if you view an advert one
week you may have forgotten it by the following week
because of the time that has passed (Zielske & Henry,
1980). However, there is much evidence to suggest
that forgetting is not simply due to the passing of time
but that it is more to do with the additional learning
that happens during that time (McGeoch, 1932).
Research shows that people are more likely to be able to
remember information for a period of time if relatively
little learning takes place in the interim (Roediger &
Crowder, 1976). There are two types of interference
that may affect a consumer's memory: retroactive
interference, where new information is learned that
makes it harder to recall earlier information, and
proactive interference, where prior learning can
interfere with a person's ability to learn and recall new
information. Retrieval failure is generally accepted as

one of the main causes of forgetting: the information
is stored in long-term memory, but the difficulty is
accessing the information again. Information is accessed
by using cues to help find the correct information so, if
more similar information has been learned, it will make
it harder to retrieve the specific memory you are trying
to recall.
McKinney (1935) investigated the role of retroactive
interference in advertising by asking participants to
study one full-page magazine advert. Then half of the
participants were given a rest period while the other
half were given two more adverts to learn (the 'work'
condition). Participants were then given a cued recall
test (where they were given cues to help trigger their
memory) and results showed that those in the rest
condition were more likely to remember the slogan
of the advert (94%) than those in the work condition
(72%), suggesting that the subsequent learning
interfered with the ability to recall the original advert.
Blankenship and Whitely (1941) investigated proactive
interference in advertising by asking participants to
learn either one list of 18 store items and prices, or to
learn the list, after also learning a previous list. Their
results showed that, 48 hours later, those who only had
to learn the list were more likely to recall the items than
those who had also learned a previous list, suggesting it
is the previous information that interfered with the recall
of information.
Example study
Burke and Srull (1988) aimed to discover whether a
consumer's ability to recall distinctive brand informatin
from an advert would be hindered if they subsequently
view an advert for another similar product by another
brand, or for another item by the same brand. They
were also interested in how memory was affected by
the consumer's information processing objective (the
reason why they were looking at the advert). The
researchers reported on three experiments, of which we
will look at the first two. In Experiment I participants
were shown 12 adverts (three of which were the target
adverts they would later be asked to recall, which were
presented near the beginning of the series) and the
information processing objective was manipulated by
asking participants to either decide how likely they
270)
would be to buy that product, or how interesting they
thought the advert was. The 12 adverts were either
similar products by different brands, different products
by the same brand, or a range of different products and
brands. Following viewing, participants were given a
questionnaire about magazine and television viewing
habits as a distractor task and were then given a surprise
recall test where they were given the brand name and
product number of each of the target adverts in turn
and were given 2 minutes to recall any information
about the advert.

Figure 7 .17: Results from Burke and Srull's Experiment
1 (1988)
Results showed that participants recalled on average
twice as much when they had been asked to rate
intention to purchase, rather than just rating the advert
on interest, suggesting that purchase intention leads to
closer attention being paid (see Figure 7.17). Results 
also showed that recall was significantly lower for those
who subsequently viewed adverts for similar products or
the same brand ( compared to those who viewed a range
of product adverts). This shows retroactive interference
because the new learning (the adverts that were viewed
after the target advert) interfered with the ability to
recall information about the target advert. However,
information processing objective (whether the consumer
was looking to decide on purchase intent or just rating
the advert on interest) mediated this effect and results
showed that the memory of participants looking at
an advert with a purchase intent was less likely to be
affected by interference from other adverts.
Experiment 2 was designed the same way, but was
intended to investigate proactive interference. As such
in Experiment 2 the target adverts were presented later
in the series, to see if earlier information interfered
with recall of target adverts. Results were similar to
Experiment 1: those rating on purchase intention
recalled more information and those viewing similar
product adverts remembered less information correctly.
However, unlike in Experiment 1, Experiment 2 did
not find that information processing objective had a
significant mediating effect on the influence of similar
product adverts.
RESEARCH METHODS
Burke and Srull's use of laboratory experiments
offers a highly controlled method, giving high
validity and reliability. Validity is high because
extraneous variables are controlled so we can
be confident that any changes in response by
the participants will be due to the change in the
independent variables. For example, adverts were
shown in a specific order, and for the same length
of time so we know that changes in recall can't
be due to some participants viewing the material
for longer. This increases the validity. Reliability is
also high because of the standardised procedure
used. Each participant followed the exact same
procedure in terms of the instructions they were
given, the times, the order, the distractor task
and the cues used in the recall test. Therefore,
because everything was kept the same for each
participant, we can be confident of consistent,
reliable results.

ISSUES AND DEBATES
Research into the two thinking systems (System
1 and System 2), and the way this impacts our
decision-making can be seen to be deterministic.
The suggestion is that System 1 (thinking fast)
is automatic and unconscious and that we use it
almost all the time. This has been used to explain
why we may make errors in decision-making.
This is deterministic because it suggests that
errors in decision-making happen because we
are automatically using System 1 thinking, rather
than System 2 (thinking slow). However, one
could argue that this explanation ignores free will
and that we are responsible for our own actions
and our own decision-making so if we make an
error that is due to our free will, and our choice
not to engage in System 2 thinking. How could
the idiographic versus nomothetic approach be
applied to research into mistakes in decisionmaking?

Gift wrapping
This section will look at gift wrapping, which is used in
many cultures around the world to signal that an object
is a gift. There is no ambiguity. This means that the
beliefs of both the giver and the recipient are important:
a wrapped gift means that each knows exactly the
roles that they are supposed to play. We will consider
the beliefs of the giver and the recipient, why gifts are
wrapped and types of wrapping.
271 ) 
) CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL AS & A LEVEL PSYCHOLOGY: COURSEBOOK
Porublev et al. (2009) suggest that gifts can be presented
in one of three ways: unwrapped, wrapped in a nontraditional manner where it may be difficult to determine
that the gift is actually a gift (such as in a bag) or
wrapped in a traditional manner. Howard conducted a
study in which he examined how the appearance of a
gift influenced mood. He found that people were happier
when presented with a traditionally wrapped gift than
with either a non-traditionally wrapped or an unwrapped
gift. Unwrapped gifts can be acceptable, for example, if
you were invited to a dinner and took a box of chocolates
as a gift, you would probably not wrap it, but if it was
being given as a birthday present you probably would.
In the study by Porublev et al., three data collecting
techniques were used: (1) observations conducted at a
Christmas gift-wrapping stall; (2) 20 in-depth interviews
where respondents were asked to reflect on gift wrapping
(including questions such as 'Do you prefer to receive
gifts that are wrapped or unwrapped?', 'In what instance
do you wrap gifts?', 'In what instance do you not wrap
gifts?') and (3) six workshops where, in pairs, participants
were asked to wrap two gifts, one for someone they were
close to and one for an acquaintance, and to have a
conversation about gift wrapping while doing so.
Results from both the workshops and the interviews
revealed that most participants preferred to receive a gift
that was wrapped and that there were clear expectations
of what a gift should look like.
The researchers used qualitative data to support their
findings that gifts should be wrapped. For example, one
of their participants said 'I prefer wrapped. I like the
reveal ... I like a gift under any circumstances, but it does
mean somebody's taken a little bit of extra time and put
extra thought into it.' Participants also identified that gift
wrapping was traditional, and that people probably do it
without thinking too much about why they are doing it:
it is just 'what you do' (see Figure 7 .18).
Figure 7 .18: Gift wrapping is important for both the giver
and receiver
272)
There was also a preference for a gift to look like a gift.
An analysis of the gifts created in the workshops showed
that all 24 of them looked like gifts, with traditional
wrappings: paper, decorative bags with ribbons, bows and
other embellishments. It was suggested that this indicates
social expectations of what a gift should typically look
like. Participants in the gift-wrapping task reported
'playing it safe' with wrapping the gift for an acquaintance.
However, when wrapping a gift for a close friend or family
member they were able to relate this directly to the person,
choosing colours and patterns that they knew the person
would like. The researchers concluded that gifts should
be wrapped because wrapped gifts make it easier for the
exchange to occur because they 'enable the giver and
receiver to fall into their roles without any confusion
as to the purpose of the exchange'.

& Galetzka, M. (2011 ). Tough package, strong
taste: the influence of packaging design on taste
impressions and product evaluations. Food quality
and preference, 22(1 ), 17-23.
Context
The food package design is an important aspect of
any product as it is what consumers will first see of a
product. When making a decision about which product
to buy, a consumer is often faced with a huge array of
options, so it is important for a product to stand out and
to appeal to a customer. Previous research in this area
has shown that product design helps aid a decision in
the absence of information about a product, for example
when a new product becomes available.
There are many factors related to food package design that
have been shown to influence consumers' perceptions of the
product, in terms of taste, quality and price expectations.
Not only can product packaging affect our perception of a
product, research has also shown that it can have an effect 
on our actual experience of the product. There are several
different features of packaging design that need to be
considered, two of which are the colour and the shape.
Main theories and explanations
Evidence shows that consumers often base their purchase
decisions on the visual appearance of the product, either
the packaging or the item itself if it is visible (Bloch
1995). Colour of packaging has been specifically shown
to influence consumer's taste perceptions. For example,
research by Hine (1995) showed that adding 15% more
yellow to the green colour of a 7-Up (a fizzy drink) can led
to participants experiencing the taste of the drink as more
lemony (even though the drink remained unchanged).
Packaging shape has also been shown to have an effect
on consumer's perception. For example, Berlynne (1976)
found that angular shapes tended to induce associations
with energy, toughness and strength, whereas rounded
shapes tended to be associated with approachability,
friendliness and harmony. Research has also shown that
packaging shape influences consumer's perception of
the quality of the product and, consequently their price
expectations (Chitturi et al. 2019).
Aims
The aim was to investigate the effect of packaging shape
and colour on consumers' perception of the product.
There were four hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1: An angular, rather than rounded, package
will lead consumers to experience the product taste as
more intense.
Hypothesis 2: A highly saturated, rather than lowly
saturated, coloured packaging will lead to consumers
experiencing the product taste as more intense.
Hypothesis 3: Shape-colour congruency (angular shape
and highly saturated colour or rounded shape and lowly
saturated colour) will lead to a more positive overall
product attitude than shape-colour incongruency
(angular and lowly saturated colour or rounded and
highly saturated colour).
Hypothesis 4: All predicted effects will be greater for
those with a sensitivity to design compared to those
indifferent to product design.
Design
A field experiment was used, where participants were
approached and asked to take part in a 'taste test' for a
new brand of yoghurt. There were 151 participants, who
7 Consumer psychology
were customers of a large German supermarket. There
was an equal split of men and women and an age range of
15-81 years. Participants were approached at the entrance
to the supermarket, so this was opportunity sampling. The
experimental design was independent measures, where each
participant was in one condition only.
Pretesting was used to design an angular and rounded
shape and a highly saturated (high intensity of colour) and
lowly saturated (low intensity of colour) colour packaging.
A (different) set of participants were asked to rate three
variations of angular and three different variations of
rounded shapes on a range of different items, to identify
the pair of shapes that led to the greatest difference in
ratings. The same process was applied with two pairs of
saturations of lemon-green. These pre-tests lead to the
four lemon yoghurt product variants that were used in the
main experiment: these are shown in Figure 7.19.
Each participant was shown a 20-second 3D clip on a
laptop of one of four package variants and were then
given a sample to taste (the same sample was used for all
participants). Participants were then asked to complete
a computer-presented questionnaire, using a sevenpoint Likert-type scales to assess their taste experience,
product evaluation and price expectation, as well as a
scale to assess their sensitivity to design.

Results, findings and conclusions
An analysis was carried out to see if package shape and
colour had a significant effect on perceived packaging
potency ('This product package strikes me as potent').
Potent means powerful, intense or strong. The effect of
packaging shape was significant, with an angular shape
being perceived as more potent. However, there were
no significant overall effects of colour on packaging
potency, except for participants with high design
sensitivity (where highly saturated colour packaging
was perceived as more potent). Results showed that
neither packaging shape nor colour had a significant
overall effect on intensity of taste experience, except for
those with a high sensitivity to design, where an angular
shape did have a significant effect on intensity of taste
experience. Product colour did not have a significant
effect on overall attitude to the product, but an angular
shape did lead to a significantly more positive attitude
than the rounded shape. Finally, in terms of price
expectation, an angular packaging led to a significantly
higher price estimate than a rounded shape, and the
lowly saturated colour led to a marginally higher price
estimate than the highly saturated colour. Further
analysis showed that the angular shape led to a higher
price estimate because it was perceived as more potent.
The results showed that packaging colour and shape
may influence product potency perceptions and that
this may in turn lead to higher price expectations.
Specifically, the results showed that an angular shaped
package may lead to an intense taste experience,
supporting the idea of a cross-modal (across the senses)
correspondence (Schifferstein & Spence, 2008), and that
this is particularly the case for those who are sensitive
to design. Packaging colour did not have the expected
effect on taste or product evaluation, so perhaps the
variation was too subtle to have an impact: this could
be investigated further. This research has important
implications as it shows that it is important to design
the 'right' package for the 'right' taste. Of particular
practical importance is the finding that lowly saturated
colour packaging led to a higher price expectation than
highly saturated colour packaging. This goes against
a common strategy used in promotions or sale items
where the tendency is to use highly saturated colour
packaging to draw attention to the product, but this may
have the unintended effect of associating the product
with 'cheapness' or low quality.
Evaluation
A field experiment was used, so there is high ecological
validity, meaning the results of the study can be
applied beyond the research setting. The participants
did not know the true aim of the experiment, which
means there was less chance of demand characteristics
and the risk of participants changing their behaviour
accordingly, thus increasing the validity of the results.
The study used a good-sized sample with a balance
of gender and wide range of ages, which means the
results can be generalised to the wider population.
However, all participants were from the same
area in Germany so results may not be applicable
to other cultures. The study used a standardised
procedure, where all participants experienced the
same instructions, the same video clips, were given the
same sample to taste and were given the same set of
questionnaires to answer, thus increasing the reliability
of the study. Quantitative data were gathered using
the seven-point Likert-type scales, meaning the results
can be compared and analysed. However, a lack of
open questions means that there were no qualitative
data, so we do not have details about the participants'
thoughts and feelings or their reasons for the
answers they gave.
Becker et al. 's research can be applied to everyday
life because it has demonstrated consumers' views
on food packaging and the implications that has for
the perception of the product itself. This can be used
by food package designers as a useful tool to guide
decision-making in terms of shape and colour of the
package. Packaging is one of the main components
that a customer will use to make a purchase
decision about a food item, so using information
gained from research such as Becker et al. will be
a valuable asset.
Attention and shelf position
Where a product is on a shelf can be a significant
indicator of how likely it is to be selected for
purchase. The amount of time a consumer pays
attention to an item, and how likely they are to buy
that item has been shown to be influenced by where
it is in the array of products, as investigated by Atalay
et al. (2012). 
Example study
Atalay et al. (2012) used eye-tracking technology to
identify the customer tendency to choose the option in
the centre of the array (a variety of different versions
or brands of the same item presented together). It
was important to ensure the item in the centre of the
array was not just selected because it was also in the
participants' centre of vision, so to test this, Study 1 was
split into Study lA and lB.
Study lA involved participants looking at a screen to
make a decision about a product, while a discreet infrared camera recorded their eye gaze and tracked the exact
location of eye fixations (the location of where their eyes
focused) on the screen.
Participants reviewed two product categories: vitamin
supplements and meal replacement bars. Two separate
planograms were displayed. A planogram is a diagram that
shows how and where specific retail products should be
placed on retail shelves or displays to increase customer
purchases. Planogramming is a skill used in merchandising
and retail space planning. There were three brands and
each brand appeared three times. Participants were asked
to carefully review each product on the screen as if these
were on the shelf in a shop. They were asked to hit the enter
key when they had finished reviewing the products and
were ready to make a choice. Once they hit the enter key,
the stimulus disappeared from the screen to ensure that any
further visual processing was stopped. Participants indicated
their choice by ticking the box that matched the position of
the product on a 3 x 3 matrix that mirrored the planogram.
Results of Study lA showed that brands in the centre
received more frequent eye fixations and overall were
looked at for longer. This was particularly the case nearer
to decision time; an effect that is known as the central gaze
cascade. Further analysis revealed that products placed
in the centre were chosen more often and this choice was
unrelated to other inferences made about the product and
was solely related to increased visual attention.
Study 1B was identical except that the shelf arrays were
presented to either the left or right of the computer
screen so that the item in the centre of the array was
not also in the centre of the visual field. Results for
Study 1B were the same as for Study lA, which shows
the item being central in the array (shelf position) is the
important factor, not just the position in the visual field.
Study 2 was conducted to see if the results could be
replicated in a more realistic context, rather than on a
screen. Participants were asked to select one item from
a set of three fictitious brands of energy drink.
7 Consumer psychology
Participants were tested one at a time and were
positioned in the middle of the display so that the
category they were asked to choose from was to their
left or their right (but never exactly in the centre of
their visual field). They were not allowed to reposition
themselves (which would have put the category in the
centre of their visual field) and were simply asked to
review the items and to choose one of the energy drinks.
Results showed that the centrally located brand within
a product category is more often chosen even when it
is not in the centre of the visual field. This again shows
just how robust the central gaze effect is and that it is
not a product of screen-based presentation.
A study in a real shop also confirmed that the centrally
located item is chosen more often, even when this is not
the centre of the visual field (see Figure 7 .20).
Interestingly, although the brand in the centre was
chosen more often and received more visual attention,
it was not evaluated any more positively than the other
items. This suggests that more research is required to
investigate why the central brand is chosen most often.

RESEARCH METHODS
Atalay et al.'s study had high validity because
they used different studies to test that changes to
the dependent variable are truly because of the
independent variable. Study 1A appeared to show
that items in the centre of the array were chosen
more often, but because those items were also in
the centre of the field of vision, the researchers
carried out Study 1 B to check what influenced the
choice. Study 1 B adjusted the view so that items
in the centre of the array were not in the centre of
the field of vision as well; the fact that those in the
centre of the array were still chosen most often
increases the validity. Furthermore, by carrying
out a similar study in real-life the researchers were
able to increase the ecological validity of their
findings; they have shown that these findings
do not just occur in computer-based laboratory
studies but also in real-life settings.
ISSUES AND DEBATES
Research into the effect of shelf position takes a
nomothetic approach, where a universal set of
rules has been suggested to explain the behaviour
of everybody. This is based on gathering large
amounts of data. In the case of Atalay et al.,
they gathered data using eye tracking, which is
a scientific and objective measure but does not
consider the individuals' thoughts, feelings and
attitudes. Consideration of everyone's individual
thoughts and feelings would follow a more
idiographic approach, where everyone would
be considered independently and a range of
factors relating to them would be considered. For
research into consumer psychology, a nomothetic
approach is the most useful and practical as it
allows retailers to design and lay out their stores
in a way that will be successful for most of their
customers. "

","Selling the product
Sales techniques
There are several strategies that can be used to sell a
product: customer-, competitor- and product-focused.
Each of these strategies will have an effect on the
buyer-seller relationship. With a customer-focused
sales technique, the seller looks carefully at potential
customers, identifies what they want and tailors their
sales techniques to match these needs. This is sometimes
called 'solution-selling' and advertisements based on
solution-selling highlight exactly how the product suits
the customer. For a customer-focused sales technique
to be effective the seller requires as much information
about the customers and their needs as possible.
They also need to think about having a long-term,
positive buyer-seller relationship, not only because
loyal customers will spread the word and advertise
the business for the seller, but also because satisfied
customers will return. If a car dealer listens carefully
to what a customer says they need and finds a car that
perfectly suits their needs, there is every chance that this
customer will come back next time they are buying a car
and would recommend the dealer to friends.
The second strategy is the competitor-focused sales
technique, where the seller focuses on how they compare
to their competitors (see Figure 7.21). This is comrilon in
supermarkets for example, where advertisements regularly
draw direct comparisons between prices in different shops.
Competitor-focused sales techniques are also essential
if your product is relatively similar in price to your
competitors. In this case, the retailer needs to convince the
customer of other advantages of buying from them, so the
buyer-seller relationship will be focused around customer
service, after-sales care or guarantees.
The final strategy is the product-focused sales technique,
where the needs of individual customers are ignored,
and the focus is primarily on producing or selling a
quality product (see Figure 7.22). The assumptions are
that if you have the best product then the customers
will come to you and that creating a new, high-quality
product could even create a customer need that did
not exist before. Apple is a perfect example of an
organisation which focuses on the product. This

strategy will have a negative effect on the buyer-seller
relationship because the individual buyer is not seen as
important to the seller.
In reality, however, it is not easy to separate out these
techniques. A customer-focused sales pitch may well
include elements of competitor comparison as well as
product quality.

7 Consumer psychology
Interpersonal influence techniques
The disrupt-then-reframe (DTR) technique is intended to
confuse consumers with a disruptive message and then
reduce this confusion ( or ambiguity) by reframing the
message. For example, Davis and Knowles (1999) asked
participants if they would like to purchase Christmas
cards sold by a charity. In some of the conditions, the
experimenters used the DTR technique by saying 'The
price is 300 pennies ... I mean 3 dollars'. The use of this
technique doubled sales. Fennis et al. (2004) also showed
that using the DTR technique reduced the number of
counterarguments and disagreements from customers.
An important factor that may influence the likelihood of
the DTR technique being effective is the customer's need
for cognitive closure (NFCC). This refers to the extent to
which the customer has the 'desire for a firm answer to a
question and an aversion toward ambiguity' (Kruglanksi
& Webster, 1996). Someone who is high in NFCC will
be unsettled by the confusion and ambiguity caused in
the DTR technique so will be keen to grab on to any
information that eases that ambiguity. The reframing
that follows the confusion in the DTR technique will
make the customer more likely to make a quick decision,
as a way of reaching closure, and therefore they will be
more likely to agree to a purchase. However, those low
in NFCC are not as concerned by ambiguity so will be
less motivated to ease that ambiguity and therefore less
likely to be susceptible to the DTR technique.

Example study
Kardes et al.'s (2007) study involved two field
experiments and one laboratory experiment to discover
the effect of DTR on monetary contributions, and
to discover whether NFCC affected the success of
the DTR technique. Study 1 was a field experiment
conducted in a European supermarket. The researchers
set up a sales stand presenting a special offer on candy
(sweets). Confederates would approach customers
and tell them that 'as Christmas is approaching, these
boxes of Christmas candy are on special offer today'.
In the DTR condition, the confederate would then
say, 'The price is now 100 eurocents (followed by a
two second pause), that's one euro. It's a bargain.' In
the control condition (reframe only) the confederate
would simply say 'The price is one euro. It's a bargain!'
The confederate then observed the customer response.
Adding one or more boxes of candy to their shopping
cart was recorded as complying with the sales request.
A total of 147 customers listened to the whole
presentation and 54% subsequently bought candy.
However, 65% of those in the DTR group bought candy
compared with 44% of those in the control group.
Experiment 2 was also a field experiment. A male
confederate claimed to be from a fictitious student
interest group and approached students on the campus
of a Dutch university, asking them to join the group
for a small cost (three euros). Half of the students were
exposed to a DTR message and the other half were
not. After the request had been made, the participant
was also asked to complete a 20-item scale measuring
NFCC. In the DTR group, participants were told that
'You can now become a member for half a year for 300
eurocents. (followed by a two second pause) That's three
euros. That's a really small investment.' In the control
group (reframe only), they were told that 'You can now
become a member for half a year for three euros. That's
a really small investment.'
Overall, 22% of the students approached agreed to
become a member, with 30% of those in the DTR group
agreeing to join compared with only 13% of the control
group. Compliance also increased as NFCC increased:
43% of high NFCC individuals complied in the DTR
condition compared with only 17% in the control
condition. Although there was a slight difference for
low NFCC individuals (16% versus 9%) this difference
was not significant. As predicted the DTR effect was
stronger for those who were high in NFCC.
The final experiment examined this further. Participants
were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: DTR,
reframe only or disrupt only. Participants were shown one
of three videos. In the DTR condition the video showed a
male actor stating that research is essential to the quality
of education at university and that money is necessary
for research. For these reasons, he continued, the Student
Advocacy Council is arguing for 'an increase in tuition
of 7500 pennies. (followed by a two second pause.) That's
$75, it's a really small investment.' In the reframe only
condition, the participants heard the actor argue for 'an
increase in tuition of $75; it's a really small investment'
and in the disrupt only condition they heard 'an increase
in tuition of 7500 pennies'.
All participants then completed the NFCC scale.
Participants were then asked to complete a series of
other scales measuring perceived ambiguity, attitudes
and behavioural compliance.
The analysis of these data is complex, but the key
findings are as follows. When NFCC was low, the DTR
manipulation had no effect on perceived ambiguity. But
when NFCC was high, the disruption manipulation was
successful in increasing ambiguity and the reframing
was successful in decreasing ambiguity. When NFCC
was high, more favourable attitudes towards the tuition
increases were formed in the DTR condition than in the
reframe only condition, which in turn produced more
favourable outcomes than the disrupt only condition.
When NFCC was low, the DTR technique was no more
effective than the reframe only technique but was more
effective than the disrupt only technique. Overall, the
findings suggest that the DTR technique was more
effective as NFCC increased. This was also found when
analysing the behavioural measures.
The researchers conclude that the effectiveness of
the DTR technique increases as the NFCC increases
and that disruption motivates consumers to accept
a reframed message that aids closure through the
reduction of ambiguity.
Cialdini's six ways to close a sale
Most techniques for closing a sale (when the customer
buys the product) involve psychological principles drawn
from social psychology and persuasion techniques.
Cialdini (1984) cited in Cialdini 2006 suggests that there
are six ways to close a sale:
• Reciprocity: if someone gives us something, we
have to give them something in return. So free
samples in a supermarket or the promise of a free
gift with our purchase (common with cosmetics and
beauty products) is more likely to make us agree to
buy something. 
•
•
Commitment and consistency: if you can persuade
someone to make a small commitment, then
you will increase the likelihood that they will
make a larger commitment. For example, if an
online retailer can get someone to sign up to their
newsletter (which costs nothing) they increase
the chances of that person buying something in
the future. If signing up to something implies a
commitment (to exercise more, to de-clutter or
learn a new skill) then making associated purchases
is consistent with this initial commitment. Free
returns can also increase commitment: they might
make a customer think they could order several
items and then decide which ones to send back,
however, in reality, they are likely to keep all of
them.
Liking: liking may sound obvious, but it goes
beyond the actual product. If we like the
salesperson, or the friendliness of a store, then
we are more likely to purchase from that store. If
a product has been endorsed by a celebrity and
we like that celebrity, then we are more likely to
purchase the product. Consider, for example,
how many brands of celebrity perfumes there are.
Another way to create liking is to use social media
such as Facebook to show you that your friend
likes a product or has just bought a product. Hotel
booking sites will tell you that 'five rooms have been
booked in this hotel in the last hour' (see Figure
7 .23) and online auction sites such as eBay will
tell you how many views an item has had. All this
creates liking for the product through associations
and this can help to achieve a sale.
• Authority: we know that authority is powerful.
•
The experimenter in the lab coat was thought
to be partly responsible for the high levels of
obedience in the infamous Milgram experiment
(Chapter 5) and authority is equally effective in
persuading us to buy. Product advertising which
includes 'scientific' or 'expert' evidence will
convince us to buy.
Social proof: we like to have our decisions
'supported' by others. Knowing that lots of other
people have bought a particular item or booked
into the same hotel can act as 'proof' that we are
making the right decisions. For example, fashion
7 Consumer psychology
websites suggest 'best sellers' to convince us to
buy products. Looking at the reviews left by
other people on sites such as Amazon is also very
influential, and many manufacturers will offer
free products to customers in return for a review.
The principle of reciprocity (above) is likely to
mean that we will write a positive review in these
circumstances.
• Scarcity: if we think that we might miss out on
something, we are likely to make a purchase,
even on something we didn't know we wanted
(see Figure 7.24). Shops will often have 'last few
days' signs to encourage us to buy now and online
retailers make increasing use of limited time
sales, such as 'Black Friday' in the USA, which
is spreading to other countries.

RESEARCH METHODS
Kardes et al.'s use of field experiments is useful
as it tells us about how people behave in reallife settings. Asking passers-by to buy a product
without the participants knowing they are part of
an experiment is the best way to ensure we are
seeing their genuine behaviours and responses.
Not only does this give us high ecological validity,
meaning we can confidently apply the findings
outside of the research setting, it also reduces
the risk of demand characteristics. If participants
knew they were taking part in a psychological
experiment, it would be easy for them to work
out the aim and therefore potentially change
their behaviour accordingly, which would reduce
the validity of the experiment. What might be
the problem with the opportunity sample of
shoppers?
ISSUES AND DEBATES
Research into selling a product can be applied
to real life in two important ways. First, this
research will be useful for retailers, so that they
can understand how best to approach making and
completing sales. This is particularly important for
retailers who have strong competition. Knowing
which techniques are likely to be effective for
particular situations and customers could improve
training of staff and hopefully increase sales.
However, this information can also be useful for
consumers. If customers are more informed about
the psychology behind the sales techniques, and
the way in which this is likely to be successful,
the consumer can make sure that they are only
making purchases they are happy with and are
not being convinced to buy something they don't
want, or at a price they are unhappy with. "

The Engel Kollat Blackwell model of
buyer decision-making
The Engel Kollat Blackwell (EKB) model (1968) was
developed as a way of describing the active informationseeking and evaluation processes of the consumer when
making a decision. The model looks at the buyer's
280)
decision-making process and describes five activities that
occur over time:
1 Problem recognition: the consumer will realise there
is a difference between their actual state and their
ideal state, i.e., they will recognise that there is a
problem that needs solving.
2 Information search: the consumer will try to gather
information from a range of sources and will likely
accept information that is consistent with their
previously held beliefs or attitudes. Stimuli may
catch their attention, be received and then stored in
memory.
3 Alternative evaluation: alternate brands will be
evaluated, and different factors will be considered
depending on the consumer's underlying motives
and beliefs.
4 Choice: the choice will depend on the consumer's
intention, attitude and circumstances and will likely
be influenced by the views of others, such as friends
and family.
5 Outcome: after the purchase, consumers will either
feel positive or negative about the product. If
the consumer feels positive they will likely repeat
purchases and become a loyal customer. If the
consumer feels negative about the product they will
be unlikely to return.
Deciding where to buy
Deciding what shop to go to depends on many factors,
relating to the product that is to be purchased, the
shop itself and the shopper. In a study of store choice
behaviour for those buying audio equipment, Dash et al.
(1976) found that pre-purchase information about the
brand influenced store choice. Those with high level prepurchase information tended to shop in speciality stores,
whereas those with low level pre-purchase information
tended to shop in department stores. The store is chosen
based on the level of confidence the consumer has about
the store, in terms of the nature and quality of the product
and service they would receive. Furthermore, the type of
trip will affect the store decision, with small top-up trips
leading to local choices but bigger grocery shops being
selected for main weekly shops (Kahn & Schmittlein,
1989). In terms of the shopper themselves, Dodge and
Summer (1969) found that store choice was influenced
by socioeconomic background, personality and past
purchase experience. Age is also influential (Lumpkin and
Robert 1985), with older people viewing shopping as a
recreational activity so entertainment value is important,
but with less of a focus on cost or proximity to home. 
Example study
Sinha et al. (2002) wished to discover more about the
factors that influenced shoppers' choice of shops. At exits
of a range of different shops (grocery, chemist, lifestyle,
books and music, clothes and so on, see Figure 7 .25)
in an Indian town, shoppers were given a structured
questionnaire including a mix of open questions and
statements measured on a Likert-type scale, asking about
their shop choice and the reasons behind it. Using an open
question, many reasons were given for shop choice, with
the main two factors being convenience and merchandise
(70% gave these as their first reason). Ambience, patronised
store (they have visited it before) and service were other
important factors. Participants were encouraged to give
three reasons for their store choice, but only 40% managed
to provide three reasons and most could provide only one
or two. Convenience was most important for groceries,
chemists and lifestyle shops, whereas merchandise was
more important for shops selling durables, books and
music, clothes and accessories. The effect of age was of
weak significance: proximity and merchandise were the
primary factors across age groups, with those aged 30--40
and 41-50 years showing a higher preference compared
to those in other age groups. Merchandising was also
important for those aged 25-29, and ambience was also
important for those aged 25-29 and 30-40 years. Gender
also had an impact of store choice, with men more likely to
choose a shop based on proximity and women more likely
to make a choice based on merchandise. The motive for
shopping was also different for genders, with men viewing
it as a chore that needs to be completed as quickly and
easily as possible whereas women prefer to spend more
time and effort shopping. Further analysis shows that
proximity of the store is valuable, but shoppers would be
willing to travel further for a store that offers good value
merchandise and, to a lesser extent, a good ambience.

requirements, according to Sinha et al. (2002)

Post-purchase cognitive dissonance
Cognitive dissonance refers to the feeling of discomfort
that comes from holding two conflicting beliefs, or from
behaving in a different way to your beliefs. When there
is a difference between beliefs and behaviours something
needs to change to reduce or eliminate the dissonance.
Factors that increase the likelihood of cognitive
dissonance involve:
• The type of belief: the more personal the belief
is the more likely there is for dissonance to occur.
For example, buying an engagement ring has huge
sentimental importance so finding out your partner
doesn't like the ring, or having regrets about the
purchase will lead to higher levels of cognitive
dissonance.
• The value of the belief: the more important
the belief is, the greater the chance of cognitive
dissonance. For example, having strong beliefs
about the environment and buying a car that you
later find out is bad for the environment.
• The size of the disparity: the greater the distance
between the two opposing beliefs or behaviours,
the greater the chance of cognitive dissonance. For
example, if you believe you should always be very
strict and careful with money but then get talked
into buying a high brand mobile phone that costs
hundreds of dollars, when you know that a cheaper
option would be just as good.

) CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL AS & A LEVEL PSYCHOLOGY: COURSEBOOK
Example study
Nordvall (2014) wished to find out whether cognitive
dissonances would occur when participants were
choosing between organic and non-organic food. This
was of interest because most research into cognitive
dissonance has focused on high involvement shopping
(for important purchases such as a car), whereas
Nordvall wanted to investigate whether the same
findings would occur for low involvement shopping
(such as grocery shopping).
Nordvall asked 100 participants (male and female)
to complete an individual virtual shopping spree that
took about 20 minutes. Nordvall used a rate-chooserate method to measure cognitive dissonance, where
participants were asked to rate items, then choose
items, and then rate them again after they had made
their decision. In the first phase, participants were
shown a total of 50 common grocery items one at a
time (25 organic and 25 non-organic) and were asked
to rate how frequently they purchased each item on a
seven-point scale from 1 ('never buy') to 7 ('buy very
often'). This measure was used rather than measuring
the 'desirability' of an item as groceries are unlikely
to be considered 'desirable' or not. Pairs of items (one
organic and one non-organic) that were initially scored
similarly (up to two points difference on the seven-point
scale) were then presented again and the participant
was asked to choose which product to put into their
shopping basket. It is suggested that this task would
cause dissonance in the participant because they had
previously rated the items as being a similar preference,
so being forced to choose one item and reject an equally
liked item would cause a feeling of unpleasantness.
The second rating phase asked the participants to rate
each of the items again, on the same seven-point scale,
but this time they were reminded whether this was the
chosen item or the rejected item. Participants were also
asked to select from a list of reasons why they chose
their chosen item, with reasons offered such as price,
environment and health.
N ordvall expected that there would be two ways in
which participants would try to reduce their cognitive
dissonance. First, it was expected that participants
would give their chosen item a higher score and the
rejected item a reduced score in the second rating phase.
Research has also shown that giving a reason for your
choice helps to reduce cognitive dissonance, which was
also part of the second rating phase.
Results showed that there was a significant increase in the
rating given for the chosen item between the first rating
282)
and second rating (mean score of 2.62 before the item was
chosen and a mean score of 2.9 after the item was chosen).
This shows that respondents tried to reduce their cognitive
dissonance by increasing the rating for their chosen item.
However, it was also expected that participants would
decrease the rating of their non-chosen item, but this was
found to not be the case. Total reduction of dissonance
can be measured by combining the increased rating of the
chosen item with the decreased rating of the non-chosen
item. Results showed tendencies for dissonance reduction,
but the findings were not significant. There was little
difference in reduction of dissonance whether or not the
organic or non-organic item was chosen. When the nonorganic item was chosen, 'price' was the most common
reason given, followed by 'physical appearance' (although
further investigation is required to determine whether
this term was interpreted as meaning 'more attractive'
or 'looked familiar'). When participants chose the organic
item, the most common reasons were 'environmental
concerns' and 'animal welfare'. A questionnaire was
also given to participants, asking questions about social
responsibility (relating to things like caring about the
world, the environment, animal rights, etc.) and results
showed that these participants scored higher than average
on social responsibility. This makes it surprising then
that participants did not choose the organic option more
often (which would be a more socially responsible choice),
therefore showing a discrepancy between attitudes and
behaviour. It is suggested that the participants' ability
to rationalise their decision by reducing the cognitive
dissonance explains why they may keep making decisions
that differ from their values and attitudes.
RESEARCH METHODS
Sinha et al. used a mix of open and closed
questions to gather data about people's shop
choices. Open questions gathered qualitative
data, allowing detailed answers and a good
understanding of the participants' thoughts and
feelings. Closed questions used Likert-type scales
asking participants to what extent they agreed
with statements. This leads to useful quantitative
data that are easy to compare and analyse,
and ensure that all areas of interest are covered
relatively quickly and easily. The study gathered
participants from a range of different shops,
which increases the usefulness and validity of the
research as it tells us about store choice across
a variety of different requirements. Lastly, asking
participants about their store choice for the 
CONTINUED
particular trip they were making was important
in terms of validity. By asking reasons for store
choice in this particular instance the researchers
were more likely to gather valid data, compared
to if they gave out questionnaires in a laboratory
setting and asked for hypothetical store choices
for hypothetical trips. ISSUES AND DEBATES
Sinha et al. carried out their research in an Indian
town, in response to the limited amount of
research into retail behaviour in India. The issue
of cultural differences is, of course, extremely
important for this research; it was in fact the
reason that the research was carried out. Sinha et
al. were aware that the vast amount of research
that had been carried out into retail behaviour
was conducted in Western cultures, primarily
America. They felt that the findings were not
necessarily generalisable to people from India, so
they carried out their own research to investigate
retail behaviour (specifically store choice) in India.
Interestingly, the findings broadly supported
previous research findings so it may be that
cultural differences in retail behaviour are not as
large as some may think. How might the individual
versus situational explanation be applied to
research into buying the product? "

","7 .5 Advertising
Types of advertising and
advertising techniques
The Yale model of communication
The Yale model of communication was developed by
Hoveland et al. (1953, cited in McGuire, 1996), initially
to try to understand wartime propaganda during the
Second World War. The basic idea of the model can be
summarised as 'who said what to whom?' It has been
used effectively since then to understand variables that
might influence the comprehension, acceptance and
retention of persuasive messages. McGuire (1996) refined
the model and broke it down into six stages: presentation,
attention, comprehension, yielding, retention and
behaviour. In effect, a message must be presented, drawn
attention to and then understood by the audience for an
attitude change to take place and be remembered.
According to the Yale model of communication there
are five important factors in determining whether an
attitude change (and consequently a behaviour change)
will occur:
1 The source of the message: a message is more
likely to be paid attention to, and an attitude is
more likely to change as a result, if the message is
perceived as coming from someone with credibility.
This would include someone who is seen as an
expert in the field, so, for example, adverts for
skincare may use a 'skincare expert' in a white coat
to talk about the importance of a particular feature
of the product. The same information would not
be seen as being as credible, and so would have
less persuasive impact, if it came from someone
without expertise. The source of the message is also
more likely to be effective if they are deemed as
'trustworthy', which may or may not be related to
their apparent expertise. It is important to say that
it is the audience's perception of the speaker that
is important: what matters is whether an audience
perceives a speaker to be trustworthy or an expert.
KEY WORD
propaganda: when information is spread in
support of a cause; it is often seen in a negative
light, where false claims are made, and incorrect
information is spread
283 > 
) CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL AS & A LEVEL PSYCHOLOGY: COURSEBOOK
2 The content of the message: it is ultimately
important that the desired aim of the message is
made clear, and the argument is strong. However,
a message where two sides of an argument are
presented is more effective in leading to attitude
change than one that only shows one side of the
argument. For example, adverts for baby formula
will tend to discuss breast-feeding as an option for
feeding a baby and will then talk about formula
as an alternative option and will then focus on the
benefits of formula. Evidence is also an important
part of an effective message: the use of statistics or
results of research is likely to convince an audience
and therefore lead to attitude change.
3 The channel or mode of delivery of the message: the
channel through which a message is delivered may
have an effect on how persuasive a message is. A
message may be delivered verbally or in written form.
The message may be delivered via the television, or
other media such as newspapers or, in more modern
times the internet or social media. The effectiveness
of the delivery mode will vary for different audiences,
for example use of social media or television is more
likely to be effective for a younger audience, but the
use of the radio or newspaper may be more effective
for an older audience.
4 The audience of the message: age affects the
likelihood of an attitude change. Those aged 18-25
are most likely to be persuaded and those who are
older are less likely to be persuaded. A less intelligent
audience may be more likely to be persuaded as
they are less likely to understand the information
themselves so will be more likely to rely on an expert.
However, for an intelligent audience it is possible to
persuade them, but in this case, it is essential for the
argument to be valid and based on evidence.
5 The effect the message has: if an audience pays
attention to a message, and retains the information
then the message can have a range of different
effects. First, the message can affect the opinions
and thoughts of the audience. If an audience has
paid attention to the message and the message
is persuasive enough it may lead to the audience
changing their attitude or beliefs. This is a good
start, but for the message to be truly effective it
is necessary for the effect to go beyond internal
thoughts and opinions and to lead to behavioural
changes. If a message is persuasive enough to
change the behaviours of its audience it has been
truly effective.
284)
Advertising media
Advertising can use a range of different media, from
the more traditional media of print and television to
the more recent additions of internet and smartphones.
Research has suggested that, although newspapers are
read far less now than they used to be, advertising is less
effective over the internet than through paper formats
(Lindstadt & Budzinski, 2011). It has been suggested
that this is due to 'banner blindness' (see Figure 7.26);
the tendency to avoid looking at banners when viewing
websites (Benway, 1998). Hervet et al. (2011) found
that 63.3% of banners were not looked at, compared
to research by Lohse (1997) who found that only 10%
of adverts were not looked at when presented on a
printed medium. The effectiveness of different types of
advertising media is investigated by Ciceri et al. (2020).
Figure 7 .26: Banner blindness: the tendency to avoid
looking at banners when viewing websites
Example study
Ciceri et al. (2020) used a mock newspaper for each
of three mediums: a website displayed on a laptop
computer, a printed paper edition, and a PDF file to be
viewed on a tablet. Twenty-five real static adverts were
included in each version. Each of the 72 participants
was asked to read the newspaper, at their own pace, on
one of the three media, while eye tracking and EEG
KEYWORD
banner blindness: the tendency to avoid looking at
banners containing adverts, when viewing websites 
measurements were taken. EEG is a method in which
electrodes are placed on the scalp to measure cortical
activity as a response to changing stimuli. The EEG
was designed to measure the level of frustration felt by
participants when viewing the adverts.
Once the newspaper task was completed, it was followed
by a distraction task for an hour and then a memory
recognition task, where participants were shown
50 adverts (25 were the ones they had seen and 25 were
unseen) and were asked to say whether they had seen
each advert.
Results from eye tracking showed that there was a
significant difference in the amount of fixation time on
adverts between the three media, with the most time
being spent on tablets and the least time being spent
on the website. These findings were supported by the
recognition task, which found more accurate recall was
found for those viewing the tablet, and least accurate
recall for those viewing the website. EEG results
showed that, when viewing adverts, participants were
less frustrated when viewing them on the tablet and the
paper, but more frustrated when viewing them on the
website. This could be due to the acceptance that adverts
are part of a newspaper (when viewed on paper or on
tablet) but that advertising on the internet is perceived
as irritating. Overall, the results for tablet and paper
were not significantly different but viewing on websites
was found to be significantly different from tablets
across all measures. This study shows the importance of
considering the media that is being used for advertising,
and that marketing should consider the implications of
this.

Lauterborn's 4Cs marketing mix model
Lauterborn (1990) proposed the 4Cs marketing mix
model, as illustrated in Figure 7.27, as a more customerfocused take on the classic marketing mix model
where the main 4Ps relate to product, price, place and
promotion. Instead, Lauterborn proposed the following
key issues in marketing:
•
•
•
•
7 Consumer psychology
Consumer wants and needs (corresponding to
'product' in the 4Ps): moving the focus away from
the product and instead basing decisions on what
the consumer actually wants and needs.
Cost to satisfy (corresponding to 'price'): this is
more complex than simply the purchase price. Cost
to satisfy considers a range of factors that, as well
as price, also includes the time taken to make the
purchase, the cost of conscience to use the product,
the cost of moving to a new product and of not
selecting an alternative.
Convenience to buy (corresponding to 'place'):
nowadays most purchases can be made online so
the convenience to buy is higher than ever. There is
no need to go to a physical shop and online baskets
and trolleys can be saved and returned to with ease.
Communication (corresponding to 'promotion'):
rather than promotion, which is very much a oneway system of communication from the company
to the customer, communication suggests a twoway conversation between the company and the
customer, and this has increased significantly as
digital marketing has developed.

RESEARCH METHODS
Ciceri et al. used a laboratory experiment to
investigate advertising in different types of
media. This has important strengths as it allows
the researchers to have control over variables,
so they can be fairly certain that the change in
cued recall of adverts is because of the different
forms of media, rather than anything else. This
increases the validity of the study. It also means
the study has high reliability because it can be
easily replicated, with the same procedure being
used. However, a weakness of using a laboratory
experiment is that it lacks ecological validity, which
means we need to use caution when generalising
the results beyond the research setting, so it may
not be a true reflection of how people relate to
adverts in real life.
ISSUES AND DEBATES

of communication, Ciceri et al.'s research into
advertising on different types of media and
Lauterborn's 4 Cs marketing model all have
significant application to everyday life. Advertising
is everywhere, and it is the best marketing tool
there is, so any research into how to produce an
effective advert is going to be extremely useful for
those who market almost any type of product. The
way in which advertising works has changed over
the years, particularly in terms of technological
changes to media, but also changes to the
way the 'relationship' between the seller and
the consumer should be viewed. It is therefore
important for marketing teams to be up to date
with new research and use these findings to
produce the most effective and successful adverts
they can. "

Context
There are many different types of advert and different
approaches to advertising. There is not one type of
advertising that will always be the most successful (if
there was, then everyone would use it all the time!). The
product itself is one thing that will affect which type of
advert to use, whether it is a luxury item, or a budget item,
or whether it is a practical and useful item or whether it is
purely for fun. For example, an advert for a high budget,
luxury item might focus on all of the reasons why this
product is worth its money, and why the consumer should
want to spend their money on it. In contrast, a lowercost, budget item might emphasise that low cost in its
advertising and use the price as the selling point.
However, the product itself isn't the only thing that affects
how successful an advert will be, this also depends on the
consumer. Research suggests that the extent to which
different types of advert are successful is in part due to
the personality of the consumer (Fox 1984). One of these
personality differences, which will be investigated by
Snyder and DeBono, is levels of self-monitoring.
Main theories and explanations
High self-monitoring individuals are those who strive
to be the type of person required for any situation
they are in. They adjust their behaviour to fit in to
different social situations and their behaviour changes
from situation to situation (Snyder and Monson 1975).
Low self-monitoring individuals are people who do
not tend to amend their behaviour to fit into different
social situations. Instead, they are guided by their own
attitudes and feelings, so there will be correspondence
between their private attitudes and their actual
behaviour (Snyder and Swann 1976).
KEYWORDS

KEYWORDS
'soft-sell' approach: the product image is central
to the marketing approach
'hard-sell' approach: the product quality is
central to the marketing approach
Previous research has shown that advertising can be
successful using either a 'soft-seU' approach or a 'hard-sell'
approach (Fox 1984). In a 'soft-sell' approach the product
image (focusing on the effect the product may have on a
person's status or the way in which others may see them)
is central, for example, in advertising a brand of coffee,
the handsome well-dressed man who is drinking the coffee
is the focus. In a 'hard-sell' approach the product quality
is central, so when advertising a new brand of coffee, the
focus would be on the quality of its taste or information
about the quality of the blend that is used. The researchers
were interested to see whether low self-monitoring
individuals and high self-monitoring individuals are
susceptible to different types of advert.
Aims
The aim of Study 1 was to investigate whether high and
low self-monitoring individuals will respond differently to
two different advertising strategies: those that focus on a
product's image and those that focus on a product's quality.
Study 2 aimed to determine whether the type of advert
(focused on product image or product quality) used
would affect the amount a consumer was willing to pay.
Study 3 aimed to find out whether these differences
between high and low self-monitoring individuals
extended further and would actually influence the
likelihood of consuming a product.
Design
In Study 1, participants (male and female undergraduates
from an American university) were given the Selfmonitoring Scale to complete, and based on their
scores, half of the 50 participants were categorised as
low self-monitoring and half were categorised as high
self-monitoring. Three sets of magazine adverts were
created, with each set containing two adverts for one
of three products: whisky, cigarettes or coffee. For each
of the two adverts the picture was the same, but the
slogan was varied, to relate to either the image of the
product or the quality of the product. A laboratory
experiment was used, where participants were asked
to look at all three sets of two adverts, with the order
7 Consumer psychology
of presentation being counterbalanced (to account for
order effects). Participants were then asked to complete
a 12-item questionnaire, asking them to make evaluative
comparisons between the two adverts for each set.
Study 2 used 40 participants (with the same features as
in Study 1) and the same six adverts as used in Study 1.
However, here the participants were in groups of three to
four and they were randomly assigned to be shown either
the three product-quality oriented adverts or the three
product-image-oriented adverts. Participants were asked to
complete a questionnaire after each advert, with the critical
item being 'How much would you be willing to pay for this
product?' and were given a range of prices to choose from.
Study 3 used a similar pool of 40 participants as the
previous two studies. In this study, an experimenter (blind
to the self-monitoring score of the participant) phoned
each participant and claimed to be a market researcher
asking whether they would be interested in trying a new
shampoo. He then delivered one of two messages about
the shampoo: an image message or a quality message.
The image message reported that lab tests showed that,
compared to other brands, the shampoo was rated as
average for how it cleans your hair, but above average
on how it makes your hair look. The quality message
reported that laboratory tests showed that, compared to
other brands, the shampoo was rated as average for how
good it makes your hair look, but above average for how
clean it gets your hair. Participants were then all asked
which response best described how willing they were to
use the shampoo: definitely not, probably not, unsure,
probably yes, or definitely yes, and to give a percentage
indicating how willing they were to use the shampoo
(0% being not at all and 100% being definitely willing).
Results, findings and conclusions
Results of Study 1 showed that, as expected, high selfmonitoring individuals reacted more positively towards
the image-focused advert than did low self-monitoring
individuals. In contrast, low self-monitoring individuals
were more favourable towards the product-quality
focused adverts. This was the case for all three of the
products advertised.
Study 2 showed that, as expected, high self-monitoring
individuals were willing to pay more for products if they
were advertised using an image orientation than if they were
advertised with a quality orientation. Low self-monitoring
individuals were willing to pay more for products that were
advertised with a focus on quality rather than image. These
results were particularly strong for the whisky adverts, but
less so for the coffee and less again for the cigarettes.

) CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL AS & A LEVEL PSYCHOLOGY: COURSEBOOK
Results of Study 3 showed that high self-monitoring
individuals were more likely than low self-monitoring
individuals to try the shampoo if they believed it would
leave their hair looking good. Low self-monitoring
individuals were more willing than high self-monitoring
individuals to try the shampoo if they believed it would
leave their hair very clean.
From Study I it can be concluded that high selfmonitoring individuals and low self-monitoring
individuals have different preferences toward productoriented and image-oriented adverts. From Study 2 it can
be concluded that this difference in preference influences
the price that a consumer would be willing to pay for a
product, Finally, Study 3 confirmed that these differences
between low self-monitoring and high self-monitoring
individuals were also shown in their willingness to use
a product. High self-monitoring individuals were more
willing to try a product based on the images associated
with it (if shampoo made their hair look good) whereas
low self-monitoring individuals were more willing to try
a product based on the product's quality (if the shampoo
cleaned their hair well) (see Figure 7.28).

ACTIVITY 7.7
Work in pairs or small groups and imagine you
are working on an advertising campaign for a new
brand of sunglasses. Your task is to create one
advert that would appeal to low self-monitoring
individuals and one advert that would appeal to
high self-monitoring individuals. Provide a written
justification for your choices.
REFLECTION
Take some time to look at the two adverts that
you have created and think about how you
worked on this task.
Consider:
• Did you feel confident with the task straight
away or did you need to take some time to
work out what to do?
• Did you plan effectively before starting to
produce the adverts?
• As you worked on the activity did you feel
confident in the differences between the two
levels of self-monitoring, or did you need to
revisit the section in the coursebook?
• Overall, are you pleased with the work you
have produced?
• What have you learned from the activity?
• What could you have done differently?
Evaluation
A laboratory experiment was used for Studies 1 and
2, which allowed high levels of control over variables,
increasing the validity of the study. Furthermore,
each set of adverts used the same images, and the
only change was the slogan, so we can be certain
that the change in response to the adverts must be
because of the slogan itself rather than anything else.
The studies have high reliability as all aspects of the
procedure were kept the same, allowing it to be easily
replicated. Counterbalancing was used in
relation to the order of presentation of the adverts.
This increases the validity as it removes the potential
issue of order effects. However, Studies 1 and 2 lack
ecological validity because participants were asked 
to view the adverts and comment on them: this does
not reflect the effect of adverts in real life. Study 3
was a field experiment where participants thought
they were speaking to a market researcher and hearing
genuine advertising. So, in this case, when they said
how likely they were to try the product we can be more
confident that this reflects real-life behaviour and
therefore has more ecological validity.
Application to everyday life is relevant to Snyder
and DeBono's research because, not only did they
investigate the effects of level of self-monitoring
on preference for advert, but they also went two
steps further and investigated whether this would
also influence how much an individual would pay
for a product and, finally, how likely they would be
to try a product. These last two stages are key to
application to real life as the amount someone is
willing to spend on a product and how likely they
are to try it are what really matters in the real world
of advertising and selling products. Advertising
campaigns could be produced to account for both
high and low self-monitoring individuals, to try to
maximise sales.
Product placement in films
Product placement is where a branded product is given a
prominent position within a scene in a television or film.
This might include the characters drinking a branded
soft drink or eating a branded chocolate bar. Although
product placement is thought to be highly influential,
there are remarkably few studies that examine the
effectiveness of product placement.
Product placement may work in two ways: through mere
exposure and through the use of reminders.
Mere exposure involves the product being on display
repeatedly during scenes in the film or television
programme. Research shows that repeated exposure to
an object leads to an increased positive feeling toward
that object (Harmon-Jones & Allen, 2001). The mere
exposure effect works even when the individual is
unaware that they were exposed to the object, as is often
the case in product placement. For example, somebody
may watch a television programme where people
are eating a particular brand of cereal and this may
influence their choice to buy that same brand of cereal
when they next go shopping, without realising why.
7 Consumer psychology
Product placement can also work effectively with the
use of reminders. Instead of mere exposure, reminders
can work if an individual has already been exposed to a
product. Product placement can then act as a reminder
to them, which increases the positive feeling toward that
product, and the choices they are likely to make. This
is demonstrated in more detail in the example study by
Auty and Lewis (2004).
Example study
Auty and Lewis (2004) aimed to investigate the effect of
product placement on children's subsequent choices, and
to see whether the age of the child influenced the effect
of product placement.
Two age groups of children took part in the study:
6-7-year-olds and 11-12-year-olds. The 6-7-year-olds
were selected as limited processors, who struggle to use
storage and retrieval cues, even when prompted. The
11-12-year-olds were selected as cued processors, who
can use cognitive strategies to retrieve information, but
require prompting to do so.
KEYWORD
product placement: when a branded product
is given a prominent position within a scene in a
television programme or film
Participants were 105 children from state schools in
the UK. They were randomly allocated to either the
experimental group or the control group. Children
in the experimental group were shown a short clip
from the film Home Alone. The clip showed the family
around the table eating pizza and drinking milk and
Pepsi (a branded fizzy drink). Pepsi is also mentioned by
name in the dialogue. The control group were shown a
similar length clip from the same film, in which Kevin,
the main character in the film, is shown eating macaroni
cheese and drinking milk.
After watching the film clip the children were questioned
individually and were first asked if they would like to
help themselves to a drink from the table where two
small cans of Pepsi and two small cans of Coca-Cola
were set up (see Figure 7.29). 
) CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL AS & A LEVEL PSYCHOLOGY: COURSEBOOK
In the experimental group, the children's choice of drink
was recorded while the child was being asked to describe
as much as they could remember about the film. If they
did not mention the Pepsi specifically, they were given a
series of prompts to help them recall the brand of drink,
and the number of prompts was recorded. They were
also asked if they had seen the film before and, if so,
how many times.
The control group followed a similar procedure. They
were also asked about what was drunk in the clip to
see if prior viewing of the film brought about mistaken
identification of Pepsi as the drink being consumed.
Results showed that the product placement had an
effect. Children in the experimental group were more
likely to choose Pepsi (a ratio of 62:38) compared with
the control group (a ratio of 42:58).
Figure 7 .29: Children in the experimental condition were
more likely to choose Pepsi than Coca-Cola
There was no statistically significant difference between
the age groups in terms of their ability to recall Pepsi,
although the younger age group required more prompts
to get there (mean number of prompts was 4.43 for the
younger group and 2.06 for the older group). However,
results showed that the more times the children had seen
the film, the fewer prompts were needed to name Pepsi.
In terms of drink choice, children who had seen the film
previously were significantly more likely to choose Pepsi
as their drink if they were in the experimental group
(and saw Pepsi in the clip that day) than if they were
in the control group (and did not see Pepsi in the clip
that day). This shows the important effect of reminders:
previous exposure to the brand (those who had seen the
290)
film before) only influenced drink choice for those who
had been reminded of the Pepsi in the clip they viewed
that day. This experiment clearly shows that product
placement is effective: those who had seen Pepsi in the
film clip were significantly more likely to choose Pepsi
than those who hadn't seen it in the film clip (and this
effect was even greater for those who had also seen the
film previously).
KEYWORD
ratio: the proportionate number of one item
compared to another item
RESEARCH METHODS
Auty and Lewis used an implicit preference test,
where the child made a choice between the
two drinks on offer, as well as interviews. This
allowed them to gather quantitative data from
the implicit preference test, so that data could
I
be easily compared and analysed, as well as
qualitative data from the interview. This allowed
for more information to be gathered, so that a
more detailed understanding could be gained.
This increases the validity of the results. The
interview was semi-structured, whereby the
children were asked about the film but if they did
not spontaneously name the branded drink, they
were given an identical set of prompts, used in
the same order. This increases the reliability of
the results because the same format was used for
all participants, which allows the research to be
replicated. Why was it better to use an interview
rather than a questionnaire in the study by Auty
and Lewis?
ISSUES AND DEBATES
Research into product placement in films,
such as Auty and Lewis, can be seen as being
deterministic because it suggests that an
individual's behaviour (e.g., what drink to choose)
has been determined or influenced by the film
they have watched. The results of research such
as Auty and Lewis appear to suggest that this is
the case: that someone who viewed a film 
CONTINUED
where Pepsi was prominent was significantly more
likely to choose Pepsi than Coca-Cola. However,
this does ignore the factor of free will; that people
are not just subject to external forces but that they
are responsible for their own decisions and actions
so can decide freely which drink to choose, for
example. Results of Auty and Lewis are significant,
but they are not unanimous; not everybody who
had viewed product placement of Pepsi then
selected it as their drink, suggesting free will is
also playing a part. "

recognition
Brand recognition in children
Brand recognition in children is thought to be acquired
in the early years and can be explained through learning
theory. Gresham and Shimp (1985) suggest that
classical conditioning (learning through association,
see Section 4.3 in Chapter 4) is the most widely used
mechanism to influence consumers' brand attitudes.
Classical conditioning involves pairing two stimuli and
creating a conditioned response. In advertising, classical
conditioning can work in two ways: by associating
a brand with a positive feeling, and by associating a
product with its logo (Schachtman et al., 2011).
Brand recognition in children can develop over time
with repeated pairings, for example if a child regularly
sees an advert on television for McDonald's where the
logo and the name is presented alongside a film of the
restaurant and the food, the different components will
eventually become associated so that the logo alone can
be recognised as the McDonald's brand.
To measure children's understanding of advertising,
researchers have focused on two dimensions of brand
awareness: 'knowing the brand' and 'remembering the
brand' (Fischer et al., 1991). Children's knowledge of
brands can be measured in terms of brand logo, brand
character and brand advertisement.
7 Consumer psychology
KEYWORDS
brand recognition: the ability for consumers to
recognise a brand from visual or auditory cues
such as logos or slogans
brand awareness: the extent to which
consumers are familiar with a brand
Example study
Fischer et al. (1991) wanted to investigate brand
awareness in children, so they developed a game
technique to measure the recognition level for
brand logos. They gathered 22 brand logos from a
range of products, including ten children's brands
(such as Disney, Disney Channel, McDonald's
and Cheerios (a breakfast cereal)), seven adult
brands (such as Ford, Apple and Kodak) and five
cigarette brands.
Each logo was printed on a card and no information
was included that might give clues to the product
(e.g., no cigarettes were shown in cigarette logos).
Recognition was measured by asking the children
to match the 22 logo cards to one of 12 product
categories pictures on a game board (e.g., cigarettes,
television, cereal).
The study involved 229 children, aged 3 to 6 years old,
from the USA.
The results showed that, not surprisingly, the children
showed good recognition rates for the children's brand
logos. This ranged from 91% for the Disney Channel
(see Figure 7.30) to 25% for Cheerios.
All cigarette brands were well recognised, with one
brand being recognised by over half of the children.
Other adult products were recognised between 16% and
54% of the time, with car brand logos being recognised
the most.
Recognition increased with age for children's brands,
cigarette brands and adult brands. There was no
effect from race or gender. Children from homes
where parents smoked were more likely to recognise
cigarette logos.
291 ) 
) CAMBRIDGE INTERNATIONAL AS & A LEVEL PSYCHOLOGY: COURSEBOOK
The researchers concluded that children demonstrated
high recognition rates for products targeted at
both children and adults. It would be expected that
American children would recognise McDonald's
or Disney, for example. It is even reasonable that
they would recognise adult brands, such as car
manufacturers, as these advertise regularly on
television. However, it is surprising and worrying that
children would recognise cigarette brands so well,
especially considering that cigarette brands have not
been allowed to advertise on television in the USA
for many decades, including before the study took
place. The researchers claim that this shows the power
of 'environmental advertising' such as billboards,
sponsorship displays, T-shirts and other items.
Figure 7 .30: Fischer et al. found that 91 % of children
could recognise the logo for the Disney Channel
Brand awareness, brand image and
effective slogans
Example study
Kohli et al. (2007) have reviewed many other articles
and industry publications and aimed to produce a set of
guidelines for creating an effective slogan. They consider
the different types of slogan (such as jingle versus nonjingle, or simple versus complex) as well the functions
of slogans (to enhance brand awareness and positively
affect brand image). Brand name, logo and slogan are
three key elements of a product (see Figure 7.31). The
brand name is the product's key identity and cannot be
easily changed. The logo acts as a visual cue to allow
faster processing and universal brand recognition across
languages and cultures. For example, the golden arches
of the McDonald's logo can be recognised around
the world. A logo will rarely be changed significantly
292)
but may be modified or updated occasionally to stay
modern. Lastly, the slogan is very important as it can
communicate so much more than the one- or twoworded brand name or the image-based logo. Slogans
can be more easily changed and updated. Pepsi, for
example, has changed its slogan numerous times in 100
years, from 'Cures everything, Relieves exhaustion' in
1902 to 'Generation Next' in 1998 and to 'For the love
of it' in 2019.
Figure 7 .31: The brand name, logo and slogan are three
key elements of a product's identity
KEYWORDS
brand name: the name used by a company to
distinguish its products or services from other
companies' products or services. It is the company's
key identity and cannot be easily changed
logo: a symbol used by the company's to act
as a visual cue to allow faster processing and
universal brand recognition across languages and
cultures
slogan: a short memorable phrase used in
advertising a product
In the UK, several confectionary brands have changed
their names. Opal Fruits became Starburst and
Marathon became Snickers. However, they kept the
same packaging design and colours, so they were still
easily recognisable on the shelf. Brand knowledge is, of
course, essential and there are two key elements of this:
brand awareness and brand image. Brand awareness
is determined by brand recall and brand recognition.
Brand recall is the consumer's ability to remember the
brand without any help (such as prompts or cues).
Brand recognition, on the other hand, is easier as it
requires a brand being identified from a provided list.
Brand image tends to be assessed by measuring the type
and strength of brand associations. 
Slogans have two main functions: to enhance brand
awareness and to positively affect the brand image. The
effects that slogans have on brand awareness have been
investigated through 'priming' effects. This refers to the
idea that exposure to something can influence behaviour
or thoughts at a later date. If a slogan talks about a
particular attribute of a product, for example the taste,
and if this slogan is heard repeatedly then when you are
asked to rate the product on a range of attributes, you
are likely to rate taste more highly than if you hadn't
heard the slogans (Boush, 1993).
As a result of their research, Kohli et al. produced a set
of guidelines for creating an effective slogan:
• Keep your eye on the horizon: brand strategy is
about where you are and, more importantly, where
you are going. It is important not to create a slogan
that defines a brand too narrowly: it should be able
to be used for years and to accommodate scope
for change.
• Every slogan is a brand positioning tool: the
slogan should position the brand (present it in an
effective way) based on features or benefits in a
clear manner.
• Link the slogan to the brand: it may sound obvious,
but it is important that the slogan is linked to the
brand and should be used on advertising as well as
packaging. The consistent message is key, and the
slogan should evoke the brand name; an obvious
way to do this is by including the brand name in
the slogan.
• Please repeat that: different adverts tend to be
used during an advertising campaign, with the
slogan being the one totally consistent feature.
The repetition is essential in order to make the
slogan memorable and, in turn, lead to a consistent
brand image.
• Jingle, jangle: two different types of slogan are
jingle (a short and memorable song) and non-jingle
(written or spoken) slogans. Slogans are often
presented as jingles as this is thought to do a better
job of enhancing memory and recall. Yalch (1981)
investigated this by presenting participants with a
list of commonly used advertising slogans (some
jingle slogans and some non-jingle slogans) and
asking them to say which brands were associated
7 Consumer psychology
with which slogans. When asked to name the
brands without cues, Yalch found that brands with
jingle slogans were more easily recalled than brands
without jingles. However, when a recognition task
was used instead (where a list of names of brands
were provided), there were no significant differences
between jingle and non-jingle slogans. However,
jingles should be used with care as there is also
some evidence that music can interfere with other
cognitive processing. They may be better suited
to small companies with limited budgets who are
primarily looking to advertise on radio.
• Use slogans at the outset: slogans are such a
significant component of brand identity that they
must be used right from the start of marketing.
A brand's image is primarily created early in the
marketplace, so a slogan needs to be used to make
the most of the early opportunity.
• It's okay to be creative: most slogans were kept
simple because this makes them easier to recall.
However, evidence suggests that slogans that are
moderately complex (in terms of structure or
content) require a deeper level of processing, which
may lead to better recall than simpler ones.
Fischer et al. carried out their study in the
children's classroom. The use of a natural setting
was particularly important for children as it would
make them more likely to feel relaxed and to
demonstrate natural behaviours, as well as being
more likely to perform well in the task. Despite
the natural setting there were still high levels of
control and a standardised procedure was used.
Each child was given the same set of instructions,
was shown the same set of adverts and was given
the same set of categories to sort the adverts
into, thus increasing the reliability of the research.
Also, using a matching task in the form of a
game increases the validity of the results. Usual
methods for brand recognition involve written
questionnaires but this would likely make it much
more difficult for young children so it may not give
a clear and accurate account of their knowledge.

I
ISSUES AND DEBATES
The use of children in psychological research
is a sensitive issue. When children are used in
research, for example the study by Fischer et al.,
the ethical considerations need to be considered
even more closely. It is not as easy for children
to give fully informed consent to take part in
research as they may not fully understand what
is involved, so parents give consent alongside
their children. Protection from harm is particularly
important because children may respond to things
differently to adults and they may find it difficult
to communicate their feelings. This also applies to
right to withdraw: a child may not understand fully
that they can withdraw from the research, or they
may not know how to express this effectively. "
